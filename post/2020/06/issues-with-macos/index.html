			<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been running in to issues with macOS that I can&rsquo;t seem to resolve and it&rsquo;s beginning to annoy me no end.</p>
<h2 id="startup">Startup</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;d been running in to startup issues for a week or so - the Mac would boot up and I would see the Apple logo on screen with the loading bar.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.vox.me.uk/images/yosemite-stuck-progressbar.png" alt=""></p>
<p>However, the screen would then go blank and I would only see the mouse cursor if I wriggled it.</p>
<p>This might work if I disconnected my USB C cables for my attached hard drives before boot. If not, I would need to connect a wired keyboard to boot in to safe mode - as for whatever reason, my Logitech K350 would not register the key press and therefore not boot in to safe mode. Once I booted, I could then restart and it should then work.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, this was a right pain to either remember to disconnect the hard drives and then connect them again when the machine is booted.</p>
<p>However, the plan was to move the USB drives to a USB A connection and attach to a USB hub, making it easier to move them in and out, but I thought I would try a HDMI connection to the monitor, rather than USB C.</p>
<p>And that seems to have solved the bloody thing. No need to pull hard drives out before boot!</p>
<p>Why?!</p>
<h2 id="logitech">Logitech</h2>
<p>I will argue that this is a macOS problem, not a Logitech problem, though people may disagree.</p>
<p>I use a Logitech K350 and a Logitech MX Vertical. These use the Logitech Unifying receiver, a little USB wifi dongle that accepts the input from the mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>And on Windows, it works absolutely fine. I have no issues at all. However, on macOS, I&rsquo;m now getting delayed typing, missing typing and just generally it&rsquo;s a pain in the ass.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t figure out why. I&rsquo;ve moved it from using a USB hub direct to the USB A port on the Mac mini and that still runs in to issues. I can&rsquo;t see any reason for why it works perfectly on Windows and not on macOS, so I can only assume macOS is causing issues. As it works fine elsewhere, I don&rsquo;t want to be buying a new one in case that doesn&rsquo;t solve it either.</p>
<p>It means that I&rsquo;m looking at moving to a new keyboard and mouse set (wired!) to use on macOS if it doesn&rsquo;t stop being so bloody stubborn. As I used an ergonomic keyboard, this reduces my pool of keyboards significantly.</p>
<h2 id="shutdowns">Shutdowns</h2>
<p>Maybe this is related to both of the above, but the bloody machine <strong>will not</strong> shutdown.</p>
<p>I select shutdown, and then the machine will close everything and then sit there showing me the desktop.</p>
<p>Again, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve left it there for a day before and it still hasn&rsquo;t shut down and relies on me holding the power button to turn the machine off.</p>
<h2 id="cloudy-judgment">Cloudy Judgment</h2>
<p>All of the above are causing me to really consider why I&rsquo;m still using it! My experience with Mac desktops has been poor, ever since I bought my 27&quot; iMac. That managed to break down every year for the three years I had Applecare on it (broken hard drive on all three occasions) and trying to get Apple service it without you having a car is a right faff! I sold that as soon as I could when the three years was up, as I knew it was a time bomb. Then this Mac Mini, purchased in 2019, has already been for repairs once for a dead logic board.</p>
<p>It really isn&rsquo;t a good record.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a 2020 MacBook Air and at the minute, I&rsquo;ve not had issues with that. At this rate, I&rsquo;m thinking of selling this Mac Mini and relying on that and going back to Windows!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure where I stand on the new ARM Mac&rsquo;s as well. Perhaps this will be the last desktop Mac that I&rsquo;ve purchased&hellip; As I&rsquo;ll never buy an iMac again, and this Mac Mini hasn&rsquo;t filled me with confidence either. My Intel NUC is smaller, and seems to have had far less issues for a fraction of the price!</p>
