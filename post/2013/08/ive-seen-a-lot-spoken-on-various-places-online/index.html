			<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot spoken on various places online, such as <a href="http://www.macstories.net/reviews/byword-distraction-less-writing-app-for-mac/">MacStories</a> and more recently in <a href="http://ipadonly.net">#iPadOnly</a>, about <a href="http://bywordapp.com">Byword</a> so I thought it was about time I give it a go, both on iOS and OSX as I&rsquo;m a keen user of Markdown.</p>
<h2 id="byword-mac">Byword Mac</h2>
<p>Byword focuses on simplicity and minimalism and offers you a blank screen to get started. Digging into the options lets you view the meagre amount of settings, something I was after. I was doubtful in considering a move away from <a href="http://www.textasticapp.com/mac.html">Textastic</a> due to the syntax highlighting of Textastic and the ability to use <a href="http://www.pixelscript.net/monodyslexic/">my own font</a>. Based on the iOS version, I was therefore surprised to find that I could use my own font on the OSX version and so that removed a &ldquo;flaw&rdquo; I thought that I&rsquo;d have with the software. That, and the very basic syntax highlighting (the difference between the two can be seen in Figure 1).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s10/sh/bbc7de53-768c-48a2-8027-ab73af037ddf/ec685516ff2f9a793f71d877d0e3a896/deep/0/Montage.png" alt="Figure 1 - Markdown in Byword and Textastic"></p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;ve been getting on fine with it over the past week. This is down to a number of reasons. Firstly, the typewriter feature is a massively underrated feature of word editors in my opinion. It&rsquo;s not to everyone&rsquo;s taste but I like being able to keep my eyes on the centre of the screen as I type. Having it in Byword makes things so much nicer.</p>
<p>Whilst I was initially sceptical about having a separate Markdown editor, I&rsquo;ve found that this is in fact, a good move - mainly due to <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a>. I&rsquo;ve found that by moving my Markdown writing to a separate app, I can happily create a bunch of Markdown macros in Keyboard Maestro that might interfere with other editing I&rsquo;m doing in Textastic for LaTeX or any other language I&rsquo;m editing.</p>
<p>Whilst I found that the default Byword preview was pretty poor, it didn&rsquo;t bother me for long as I changed the keyboard shortcut to launch <a href="http://markedapp.com">Marked</a>. I used the same key shortcuts but was reminded of <a href="http://www.macstories.net/tutorials/automating-mail-signatures-and-senders-with-applescript-and-keyboard-maestro/">this</a> blog post stating that Keyboard Maestro intercepted the key presses before the program would so it launches Marked before Byword tries to preview it. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the built in preview works and not to badly, it&rsquo;s just that as I&rsquo;ve changed my font, it uses that font for viewing and I prefer to preview it differently to how I&rsquo;m writing it.</p>
<h2 id="byword-ios">Byword iOS</h2>
<p>Like most iOS text editors, it offers either Dropbox or iCloud file syncing and I&rsquo;m a Dropbox editor fan (namely as I&rsquo;m a keen user of Day One and found that syncs better in Dropbox). I&rsquo;ve found a few times that it has problems syncing but these tend to__ be due to my intermittent 3G connection more than anything else.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the iOS version is almost identical than the OSX version.</p>
<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>
<p>Overall, I think Byword is a decent bit of software. I&rsquo;ve not yet made the jump to buying the addon to allow for blog posting, but perhaps I should as I&rsquo;m typing this in Byword, for posting on Tumblr.</p>
<p>Either way, if you have a Markdown writing app that you currently use, there&rsquo;s probably nothing worth leaving it for in Byword. However, if you&rsquo;ve not got an app you use, then Byword can easily fill that position for you.</p>
