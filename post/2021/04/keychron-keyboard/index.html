			<p>With lockdown continuing in the UK, and working from home, I decided to look once more at the mechanical keyboard market.</p>
<p>I had been using the Logitech K350 on Windows without any issues, but for whatever reason, I wasn’t able to use this nicely on the Mac - I’d often get drop outs or lag, where what I was typing wasn’t picked up, or was lost completely <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In the mean time, I’d been using a Windows Dell keyboard - a cheap and cheerful keyboard that did the job, and I actually wasn’t getting RSI by using it! So even though it’s not ergonomic, I was able to use it successfully without getting any wrist pain.</p>
<h2 id="keychron-k1">Keychron K1</h2>
<p>I looked around - if I could get a Mac specific mechanical keyboard, that would be good. This lead to Keychron, who do Mac specific mechanical keyboards. After looking around their site for a bit, I decided on a <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k1-wireless-mechanical-keyboard">Keychron K1</a>, a low profile, Bluetooth keyboard. The intention was that if the Dell keyboard wasn’t causing RSI, then a low profile keyboard may well be fine.</p>
<p>It arrived pretty quickly considering the global pandemic and I was able to use it over the Christmas break.</p>
<p>I went with the Blue Switches, as I’ve found that the tactile keys of the Cherry/Gateron Blue’s are the best for me, though it does make the keyboard far noisier than normal! I don&rsquo;t have an issue with this and as I&rsquo;m working from home, it rarely annoys anyone else (though I do have to mute my mic when on Teams and using it!)</p>
<h2 id="keychron-k8">Keychron K8</h2>
<p>After using the low profile keyboard for a while, I found that I was missing the key travel of a full size keyboard. I was bottoming out the keys far more quickly (hardly surprising!)</p>
<p>Because of this, I ended up purchasing the <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k8-tenkeyless-wireless-mechanical-keyboard">Keychron K8 keyboard</a>, as I purchased during the Christmas period, which gave me a discount and selling the K1.</p>
<p>The K8 is almost the same, but has normal size keys, which means I’m able to type without issues. Using it for a period of time, I’m happily typing and not getting the feeling that the keyboard is to shallow.</p>
<p>I also purchased a <a href="https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07VWG39J9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">wrist rest</a> from Amazon, as I didn’t want to suffer any RSI, and I thought the wrist rest would help. Using both the K8, wrist rest and a Logitech MX Vertical, everything seems to be OK.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>The Keychron K8 is ideal. I had concerns about using a keyboard with a numpad, but after a brief period of adjustment, I got used to it, and it just meant I’d bring my USB power numpad out the drawer if I needed it.</p>

<p>However, it appears from a post on Mac Power Users that <a href="https://talk.macpowerusers.com/t/is-there-way-for-time-machine-backups-to-only-when-im-not-using-my-laptop/18393">this might</a> be related to Time Machine starting and working - which makes sense, as using a MacBook Air without Time Machine enabled it seems to work perfectly.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
