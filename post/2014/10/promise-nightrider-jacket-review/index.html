			<p>Last month, I picked up a <a href="http://www.provizsports.com/en_gb/proviz-nightrider-high-visibility-cycling-jacket">Proviz Nightrider</a> cycling jacket after reading the review by <a href="http://www.myorangebrompton.com/2014/08/the-best-waterproof-cycling-jacket-ever.html">Orange Brompton</a>. I thought I&rsquo;d write a few words on it, now that I&rsquo;ve had it for a while.</p>
<h2 id="in-short">In Short</h2>
<p>In short, it&rsquo;s good, but I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d go as far as Orange and say it&rsquo;s the best cycling jacket ever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very <strong>good</strong> jacket, but I&rsquo;m sure there are some on the market that are better. I&rsquo;ll review it and try and provide some points that I perhaps disagree with Orange on.</p>
<h2 id="review">Review</h2>
<p>Orange mentions the longer arms and back - this is a great feature and really handy. What isn&rsquo;t stated in his review (but was mentioned on a follow up on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/LondonBromptonClub/">LBC Facebook group</a>) is that the sizing is on the larger size. This seems to be the case as I ordered the large and it&rsquo;s pretty big. However, going back to Orange&rsquo;s review - the sleeves are longer. Even so, I still occasionally get the sleeves riding up as I&rsquo;m riding. This might be because the coat is a bit on the bigger side for me but I&rsquo;m not 100%.</p>
<p>I think the reflective bits are fantastic, I cant really fault them. The only issue I have is with the rear reflective panel. This is velcro&rsquo;d on to the coat which is good (and needed to attach to the Triviz light to it instead of the reflective panel) but this can occasionally interfere with a backpack (if you use one). Obviously, you could remove the panel if you&rsquo;re using a backpack because it wouldn&rsquo;t be visible anyhow.</p>
<p>For me, the biggest flaw is the zip. This just doesn&rsquo;t seem as high quality as the rest of the jacket. It&rsquo;s a bit flimsy and on occasion, it seems like it&rsquo;s got caught up but I can&rsquo;t see what on (as it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be caught on the jacket liner like other coats I&rsquo;ve had).</p>
<p>However, that&rsquo;s pretty much the issues I have with the jacket. I should note that otherwise I&rsquo;m happy with the purchase! It&rsquo;s a good jacket and makes me visible on my morning commutes (and evenings when it&rsquo;s a bit darker - no doubt after the clocks go back).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s waterproof capabilities haven&rsquo;t fully be put to the test yet but it has kept me dry in the showers I&rsquo;ve been in. The big test comes from this weekend, where I&rsquo;ll be wearing it on the <a href="http://stcrispinsdaynightride.co.uk/">St Crispins Day night ride</a>. I&rsquo;ll also be using the Triviz light for the first time (I don&rsquo;t feel the need to wear it on the daily commute really).</p>
<p>Overall, the Proviz is great value for money. I was lucky to get mine with the Triviz light and I also got 10% cash back on my purchase by going through <a href="http://quidco.com/">Quidco</a> first. This made the purchase about £50 and for the money, this jacket offers cracking value for money. Yes, there are some niggles but then it&rsquo;s not a top end jacket, up there with Rapha or similar. This is a commuter jacket - offering good value for money, excellent visibility and fantastic showerproofing. I can&rsquo;t fully comment on the waterproofing ability as I&rsquo;ve not worn it in a proper deluge yet. Overall, it&rsquo;s certainly worth checking out. If Proviz could make a few changes to the zip, they&rsquo;d be onto a winner.</p>
