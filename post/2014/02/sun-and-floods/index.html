			<p>Today was deceptively a nice day to go for a ride. The sun was out but there was still a biting wind out. However, I wanted to get out and about and the weather seemed to be decent enough so wrapping up warm, I headed out.</p>
<p>I fancied trying to cycle the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Green_Way">Cole Green Way</a> today but I thought with the rain we&rsquo;ve had recently, this was probably not the wisest idea, as I know the other path nearby, the St Albans Way, has a section that floods in the rain. Well, based on what I saw elsewhere, this would seem to have been a wise choice!</p>
<p>I got out and started cycling, and as I went to turn down a road towards Water End, a kind cyclist coming the other way advised me to turn around as the water was knee deep and not worth cycling through. So I thought I&rsquo;d cycle the long way around to get some pictures - after all, that&rsquo;s one of the resolutions this year, to get an image on each ride.</p>
<p>Well, I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed when I got there.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/113531214@N07/12253967075/"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2875/12253967075_89cbce1901_z.jpg" alt="2014-02-01 10.41.16"></a></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have to view that fullscreen to the get the full effect. As you can see, the whole road was covered - look to the right of the image to see a 4x4 trying to get through it - good thing I didn&rsquo;t try on the bike!</p>
<p>Heading up to Hatfield, I stopped a few times to adjust the saddle - think I&rsquo;ve got the seat height and saddle position sorted on the new bike now.</p>
<p>Anyhow, cycling out from Hatfield towards Welwyn and onwards to Stevenage, I again was confronted with water…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/113531214@N07/12254400484/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7422/12254400484_8ef2391c6b_z.jpg" alt="2014-02-01 11.22.39"></a></p>
<p>With this, I was a bit disheartened and thought I&rsquo;d cycle home along some routes I thought would be fairly clear. Ended up finding a shortcut from Colney Heath into Hatfield that I might take more often (depending on where I need to go in Hatfield!).</p>
<p>Anyhow, the last few pictures I got were of Colney Heath - the river there was pretty full!</p>

<p>With that, I headed back, managing to take the bike around the local quarry and bridleway as the wind round there was amazing - I was practically leaning into it as it was blowing me sideways. Not quite as <a href="http://youtu.be/H8qgjyqibwY">these roadies</a> but it wasn&rsquo;t far off (in fairness, I was probably saved by being a bigger chap and riding a heavier bike than these guys and girls!!).</p>
<p>Anyhow, a reasonable ride, a bit disappointed with the road conditions but that can&rsquo;t be helped. In fairness, the conditions today just backed up how more comfortable I felt with a hybrid than a road bike. The flat bars certainly felt safer with the wind (and not to mention the V brakes which would stop me quicker than the road ones!) and the larger tyres helped navigate the puddles and the debris left on the roads from the storms we&rsquo;ve had around the area.</p>
