			<p>So today I ended up doing another Cambridge ride - I&rsquo;ve pencilled this route in for a London Brompton Club ride in September so I thought I&rsquo;d give it another run through to ensure that I know where I&rsquo;m going and to make sure the route is fine.</p>
<p>No pictures from the ride - I think I&rsquo;m becoming guilty of jumping on the bike and just going again, it seems like I need to do a few more social rides to exorcise that from the system!</p>
<p>I completed the route this time on my S type, rather than the P type. This route should be doable on a three or six speed Brompton easily enough, though the first half may cause issues for a one or two speed as it has a few inclines - nothing to major but perhaps enough get out of breath on. The end, from about Royston, is fairly flat and allows for riders to get up to a good speed (if the wind isn&rsquo;t in the wrong direction like it was today!)</p>
<p>The big fear I had was that there was perhaps not enough places to stop - some of the route is quite desolate. However, doing the route again, there seems to be plenty of places to stop so that shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue, with plenty of places prior to Baldock (with then nothing really until Royston). Timing is my main concern - I did the route in four hours, I&rsquo;m not sure what the club is likely to do it in - maybe seven hours including a break for lunch? We did the <a href="http://ayearinbike.tumblr.com/post/77164615960/lbc-london-to-gatwick-ride">London to Gatwick ride</a> in 4 hours and 47 minutes (which didn&rsquo;t include the lunch as I turned off my Garmin), so we might be six hours I guess?</p>
<p>Either way, the route looks like it should be fine - the section on the A10 is probably the worst part but I can&rsquo;t see a way around that. There is a path alongside the road but it doesn&rsquo;t lead to the junction we&rsquo;d need to use and we would need to rejoin the carriageway to use the junction anyhow.</p>
<p>This ride marks 65% of my yearly target for cycling (2,500Km) and we&rsquo;re only 55% of the year complete. This leaves 879Km to go. However, I&rsquo;d like to break the back of this before the end of August as then the bad weather may set in. Next weekend sees me probably undertake a ride from London to Brighton with the guys from work - based on the LBC ride from Richmond to Brighton the other day, that should knock another 10% off the target. I&rsquo;m also considering doing the Devon Coast to Coast when I go home for a holiday in August if I can sort out transport plans etc - getting back home from Plymouth might be a pain so I might look at doing it in reverse and get home from Ilfracombe as that&rsquo;s easier to get back from. I think I&rsquo;ve got a route somewhere, so I&rsquo;ll look into doing that. Does mean that perhaps I might have to look into getting some more kit for the bike. Though there was talk of taking my sister hiking over Dartmoor that week so I need to figure out what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
