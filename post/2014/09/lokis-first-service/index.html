			<p>So it&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve written here, but things have changed a bit since I&rsquo;ve been away. For a start, I&rsquo;ve moved - things finally worked out and my house purchase went through!</p>
<p>That means that for a while, I&rsquo;ve been getting sorted in my new flat with everything that comes with buying your own house. On the plus side, I have a nice new location for the Bromptons!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/113531214@N07/15201159265"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5585/15201159265_f4bc54c5b3_z.jpg" alt="2014-08-29 11.40.05"></a></p>
<p>This cupboard already seems to be full of bikes and bike parts! I thought I&rsquo;d cleared some out when I moved, but it appears enough of it still followed me when I moved. I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;ll change, even if I move in with someone else!</p>
<h2 id="service">Service</h2>
<p>Anyhow, with the move complete and a few things sorted, I thought it was time to complete a few tasks that needed to be done on the Brompton.</p>
<p>Basically, I think I needed a six month service. I&rsquo;ve ridden the bike about 1,000Km within the year so far - probably more as I don&rsquo;t track my day to day cycling to and from the station. So it was probably due a new chain - it wasn&rsquo;t something that I&rsquo;d checked (but probably should have done). I also wanted to make sure that everything was ticking over nicely. Now, I am capable of doing most basic bike maintenance tasks myself, but I thought I&rsquo;d take this into Brompton Junction to get looked at (the Junction was chosen because I prefer Brompton Junction to Evans (where I bought the bike) - the staff are friendly, the prices are cheaper and as the mechanics are Brompton mechanics, they know exactly what they&rsquo;re doing on the bike). Besides, I had something extra in mind for Loki as well…</p>
<h2 id="upgrades">Upgrades</h2>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s hit September, the mornings are getting darker (until the clocks change but even then it&rsquo;ll be darker than it has been) and I&rsquo;ve been working late occasionally. Which means that I&rsquo;m returning home in the dark as well. This obviously means that I require lights, not only to comply with the law in the UK but also because I want to remain visible to cars on the road!</p>
<p>So earlier in the year, I&rsquo;d splashed out on a <a href="http://www.bikeradar.com/gear/category/accessories/lights/front/product/review-hope-vision-1-35684/">Hope Vision 1</a> light. This came with rechargeable batteries and works really well - the beam is bright with four different modes (low, medium, high powers and flashing). I&rsquo;d only used it on the continuous setting as that&rsquo;s all I ever needed. It performed well, however, it wasn&rsquo;t that comfortable on the handlebars on the Brompton really. I&rsquo;ve not seemed to be able to keep it in the same position on the bars over rough terrain. Likewise, it&rsquo;s a big bulky light and I can&rsquo;t fold the bike with the light still attached - whilst it&rsquo;s on a quick release clamp, I still at times forget to take it off, resulting in it colliding with my wheel, sometimes fairly hard - obviously I don&rsquo;t want to damage my wheel or my light!</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d been thinking of the Brompton lights, specifically the dynamo powered lights. These would always be fitted to the bike but would also solve another issue I have with my lights - that occasionally I forget them (currently, it&rsquo;s not to dark in the mornings so I can get away without them, but I might have a delay getting home in the evening and then I wish I&rsquo;d picked them up!)</p>
<p>After some thought, I decided to take the plunge and get one. Now, most members of the London Brompton Club recommend the SON hub dynamo and light package that Brompton offer - however, it&rsquo;s about half the price of a Brompton itself - almost £400 for the whole package! This seemed like a significant amount of money. The cheaper Shimano hub package costs £138 - a fraction of the price. I looked online for reviews of both and downsides of each. The only major downside I could see to the Shimano package was that the light doesn&rsquo;t have a stand light - so slow and stop and the light goes out (but not the rear one), and that the hub creates more drag. However, both issues I don&rsquo;t think are major issues for me. The plus points outweighed these (also on the bike, doesn&rsquo;t prevent the fold, doesn&rsquo;t need batteries) in my mind.</p>
<p>So I ordered these to be fitted at the same time as the parts I needed fitting.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/113531214@N07/15046812097"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5572/15046812097_1430469538_z.jpg" alt="2014-09-14 10.00.19"></a></p>
<p>Fitting these, I certainly didn&rsquo;t trust myself. I might work for a mechanical and electrical engineering firm, but theres a good reason I&rsquo;m not a mechanical or electrical engineer and that&rsquo;s because my skills in those two areas are appalling! I&rsquo;ll stick with fire (though that doesn&rsquo;t help with the Brompton!)</p>
<h2 id="outcome">Outcome</h2>
<p>So all in all, I ended up with a few new parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dynamo and new wheel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lights</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New brake pads on the rear</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New seat shim</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New hinge shims</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New chain and sprockets</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This should see me through until next year - though the front brakes are beginning to show wear as well so I might replace these myself at some point with the after market suggestions from the Brompton Club (Swiss Stop are rated highly). I also have a recommendation to change my chain grease - I&rsquo;d been using an Eco friendly one but it&rsquo;s quite thick and gloopy and seems to attract the dirt and can cause issues with the chain wear.</p>
<p>The dynamo lights I&rsquo;m happy with - I can&rsquo;t tell that there&rsquo;s any additional drag when the lights are on, so currently I feel quite happy with the cheaper option. Time might tell if I come to regret my decision, but currently, I&rsquo;m quite happy with the purchase. I&rsquo;ve found that I&rsquo;ll travel with the lights on more now - I&rsquo;m quite happy to just flick the switch if I think whether or not I should be using lights because there&rsquo;s no batteries to charge so there&rsquo;s no hassle for me or anything to think about later.</p>
