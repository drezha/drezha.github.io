			<p>Shoes don&rsquo;t seem like an interesting blog post - however, I sometimes think I&rsquo;m guilty of being the wrong sex, as I seem to have a few shopping habits that the fairer sex are often stereotypically attributed with - that is, I have a thing for good bags. However, shoes (the other vice women are usually labelled with!) are not something I usually get excited about.</p>
<p>However, this is potentially due to the fact that I could never find a good pair - I would settle for a cheap £20 pair of Airwalk&rsquo;s from Sports Direct as I seem to destroy shoes (the soles would wear through within a month or two). This was the case, even with expensive brands, such as Vans. This however, changed when I discovered Teva. Now I seem to get all my shoes from there!</p>
<h2 id="teva">Teva</h2>
<p>Teva (apparently pronounced &ldquo;teh'-vah,&rdquo; not &ldquo;tee-vah&rdquo; - apparently from the Hebrew word for nature), are an American company (owned by Deckers Outdoor Corporation, the makers of the horrendous looking Ugg&rsquo;s!). However, I don&rsquo;t hold that against them, as the shoes are decent.</p>
<p>It all started in 1984 with the creation of sports sandals. Now Teva make a range of shoes, mainly focused around water. However, they also have a range of multi use shoes, some of which are marketed as cycling shoes (see where this is going?)</p>
<p>I think I stumbled upon Teva due to a post I&rsquo;d seen somewhere on Reddit or on cycle touring where the Mush Frio was praised as a lightweight shoe that was really handy for dropping in panniers or similar. I decided to buy a pair in from the Natural Shoe Store in Covent Garden and that made me decide to check out the rest of the shoes they offer.</p>
<h2 id="mush-frio">Mush Frio</h2>
<p>I picked these up in a sale as I wanted a lightweight shoe that I could wear with no socks during the summer. I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of flip flops and I&rsquo;ve never really worn sandals but I still wanted a shoes that was light weight (I blame getting into barefoot running). The Mush Frio&rsquo;s fitted the bill and I managed to pick up a pair from the <a href="http://thenaturalshoestore.com/">Natural Shoe Store</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/113531214@N07/15103726677"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2941/15103726677_b373f59809_z.jpg" alt="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2941/15103726677_b373f59809_z.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Yes, they do seem to match the carpets in my house as well!</p>
<p>They are like flip flops - well, the soles are. The soles are basically that sort of foam that some sandals and flip flops use and the rest of the shoes are canvas. I&rsquo;ve not worn these two much during the summer but they will be making an appearance in my touring kit bag as they are lightweight and pack down nicely.</p>
<h2 id="crank">Crank</h2>
<p>I ended up buying a pair of Cranks as they were on offer and I thought I&rsquo;d risk buying them to see how they would compare to the cheap, £20 Airwalk trainers I&rsquo;d been buying from Sports Direct. Well turns out to be money well spent.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/113531214@N07/15289894302"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3897/15289894302_3688c3aa8e_z.jpg" alt="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3897/15289894302_3688c3aa8e_z.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Not only were the shoes comfortable, I still have my original pair, probably approaching two years after I bought them, though in fairness, the original pair have now been regulated to the cupboard for cycling or other muddy jobs (mainly because they&rsquo;re a bit grubby now, not that the sole has a hole in). I liked them so much, that I bought a second identical pair in a sale soon after I bought the first pair and I&rsquo;ve purchases a third pair in a different colour for other occasions! Either way, the Crank has become my go to shoes for day to day wear, though for the office, I&rsquo;ve decided I need a slightly better looking pair.</p>
<p>It turns out I now have a total of five pairs now of the Cranks in various colours and state of use! They&rsquo;ve become my shoe of choice.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/113531214@N07/15103525119"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2941/15103525119_93e3f9b178_z.jpg" alt="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2941/15103525119_93e3f9b178_z.jpg"></a></p>
<h2 id="carbon">Carbon</h2>
<p>Carbon&rsquo;s are probably the only Teva pair of shoes I regret buying and that&rsquo;s pretty much down to styling, rather than the actual shoe itself.</p>
<p>I bought them to wear into the office as I thought they were smart enough. I&rsquo;m not entirely sure they are but it turns out, I&rsquo;m not a fan of the grey and black styling either.</p>
<p>I made a mistake when purchasing these as well and ordered a Size 10, compared to 11 in the Crank&rsquo;s. Well, I managed to tear up my heels wearing them so I can only assume the size was to small or the shoes requiring some breaking in, something the other trainers don&rsquo;t need to do.</p>
<p>Overall though, the shoes compare well enough to the rest of the shoes I&rsquo;ve had from Teva. The soles are grippy enough and these are aimed at the cycling market - with small reflective patches applied to the shoes on the sides of the soles. Mind, these aren&rsquo;t particularly big, and I&rsquo;ve not seen them in action (as I&rsquo;m on the bike wearing them!). It&rsquo;s an interesting touch though and I wonder if other cycling shoes out there are incorporating it - as the patches are fairly unobtrusive during the day.</p>
<p>In the end, I got rid of these fairly quickly to a charity shop.</p>
<h2 id="roller-suede">Roller Suede</h2>
<p>These were bought to replace the Carbon&rsquo;s that I disliked. I thought that these were pretty smart to wear in the office and I&rsquo;ve been wearing them there for probably about 6 months.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/113531214@N07/15103727797"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3901/15103727797_d9971e8bab_z.jpg" alt="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3901/15103727797_d9971e8bab_z.jpg"></a></p>
<p>They seem to be fairly decent with a pair of chinos and a shirt for a fairly casual look in the office.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve bought a pair of the Roller Mesh shoes to replace these ones, as they&rsquo;re perhaps beginning to look a bit tired (and the soles on these are wearing down).</p>
<h2 id="roller-mesh">Roller Mesh</h2>
<p>I bought the Mesh ones to replace the Suede ones, basically because I thought I&rsquo;d give them a try over replacing them like for like.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/113531214@N07/15289897422"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2941/15289897422_f9e948bbb9_z.jpg" alt="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2941/15289897422_f9e948bbb9_z.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The difference is fairly minor.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/113531214@N07/15103730057"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5556/15103730057_710750db36_z.jpg" alt="Comparison of Teva Roller Suede and Teva Roller Mesh"></a></p>
<p>Perhaps the other Suede ones are perhaps a bit smarter, but these should be up to the task as well. Only time will tell!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Teva have won me over with reasonably priced shoes that perform fantastically (in my probably abnormal wear frequency!). Not only are they reasonably priced, they&rsquo;re fashionable (and some of the &ldquo;smarter&rdquo; trainers are ideal for work) and they&rsquo;re comfortable. Far cry from some shoes I&rsquo;ve worn that seem to forget that main aim of wearing shoes is to protect your feet but to be comfortable enough not to realise they&rsquo;re there!</p>
