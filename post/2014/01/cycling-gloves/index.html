			<p>So a fairly boring blog post perhaps on gloves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very rare that you&rsquo;ll catch me out on a bike without wearing gloves. Not 100% why but I also think it&rsquo;s better to wear gloves as if I come off the bike, the first part of my body that I&rsquo;ll move to try and stop myself probably is my hands. And considering I use them everyday, I kind of want them to not be to damaged.</p>
<p>Anyhow, summer gloves are never really an issue for me - I have a fairly old (and by now, pretty tatty) pair of Fox gloves but these are to thin for winter riding. I bought a pair of gloves (can&rsquo;t recall the brand name now) at the London cycle show last year and they weren&rsquo;t to bad. However, during windy days, or just fast downhill descents, wind would just tear through these and make it feel like you were wearing nothing at all. They did come with a rain cover type cover that was attached near the wrist of the glove and would unroll and cover your hand like a mitten. Nice idea (as these were also reflective, ideal for commuting). The major downside was that they were a bit small and really restricted your handling of the bike so I ended up never using those &ldquo;flaps&rdquo;. When they ended up getting a hole in last month, I didn&rsquo;t think it was worth fixing and decided to buy a new pair.</p>

<h2 id="winter-gloves">Winter Gloves</h2>
<p>Anyhow, so along I went to the local bike shop and bought a no name pair of gloves. Waterproof, windproof, the lot.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/113531214@N07/11875512506/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7427/11875512506_29affc1aea.jpg" alt="2014-01-10 18.38.45"></a></p>
<p>They&rsquo;re pretty warm and do the trick of keeping the wind out. Waterproof seems to be fairly good as well by can&rsquo;t comment to much as I&rsquo;ve not worn them in the rain much (I barely rode at the end of last year). However, I&rsquo;ve got a big issue with them and that&rsquo;s the sheer bulk of the glove. With the gloves on, I can&rsquo;t attach my lights, I can&rsquo;t even open the garage door to get the bike out! And then when I&rsquo;m on the commuter bike, I&rsquo;m just about able to operate the gears - I&rsquo;d hate to ride the road bike with these, there&rsquo;s almost no chance I&rsquo;d be able to operate the gears nicely with these! It looked like I was doomed to having fat finger syndrome or hypothermia in my hands!</p>

<p>That is, until I was in Go Outdoors over Christmas. Now I&rsquo;m a big fan of Go Outdoors (in fact, I love all outdoor shops). I was browsing the gloves and stumbled upon the Rab Powerstretch gloves.</p>
<p>These seemed almost ideal for cycling, even though they aren&rsquo;t cycling specific gloves. Maybe thats where I was going wrong, only looking at the specific ones, when I should have been looking at all gloves.</p>

<p>Whilst these aren&rsquo;t waterproof, having worn them in a torrential downpour, I can say that it takes a while for the water to soak through. In addition, they aren&rsquo;t pretty windproof - not so much as the thick gloves above, but they do a pretty good job at keeping the biting cold air out. Which, after all, is the main reason I got them. Thankfully as well, they don&rsquo;t give me fat finger syndrome. I can happily operate all the parts of my bike with them on and I can even fiddle with my Garmin cycle computer. So that&rsquo;s a plus.</p>
<p>They are missing the ever helpful terrycloth on the thumb for nose wiping (espcially helpful in the colder weather!) but I can miss out on that for having warm hands that I can actually use for operating the bike comfortably!</p>
