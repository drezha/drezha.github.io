			<p>So it was my first ride of 2014 today. I&rsquo;d been dying to get out on the bike, partly because of my new Garmin Edge 800 but also because I&rsquo;d been planning a few rides and just hadn&rsquo;t been able to shake off the flu I came down with on New Years Eve!</p>
<p>Anyhow, I managed to get out today. The idea was to get out and just go for a ride. I&rsquo;d been playing with <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/">Ride with GPS</a> to see how route planning would work with the Garmin. I&rsquo;d planned a route from Potters Bar to Letchworth Garden City, along National Cycle Route 12.</p>
<p><img src="http://ridewithgps.com/ruter/3838608/full.png" alt="Planned Route"></p>
<p>This route was about 40Km and I thought it would be a good test of the Garmin and also the <a href="http://talkytoaster.info/ukmaps.htm">Talkytoaster</a> OpenStreet maps, as I was using these as the basis of my routing as they&rsquo;re free.</p>
<p>Well I managed to get out in the morning before the weather got to bad so that was a plus. I decided that I wasn&rsquo;t going to go quite as far as Letchworth - I wasn&rsquo;t sure I would cope with there and back again today and due to engineering works, I couldn&rsquo;t rely on support from National Rail!</p>
<p>Anyhow, so I followed the course fairly well and deliberately went off course at one point early on as I wanted to initially cut straight down to the NCN 6 as soon as I left Potters Bar but I realised the road I would be going down has a flood warning normally so I avoided it and went a different way with the knowledge I could join up at a later point.</p>
<p>Turns out this was probably wise considering the scenes I saw further on my ride! The first obstacle I came across was a fallen tree over the footpath just outside Welham Green. Had to dismount and duck under for this section.</p>

<p>As I entered Hatfield along the path, the path runs alongside the river and the railway lines. Well, the river certainly looked like it had swollen.</p>

<p>As can be seen in the two images above, the water had risen right up to the path. Thankfully it was clear and I carried on.</p>
<p>The routing on the Garmin worked perfectly, though I might have a play with it as it did seem a little late giving directions (i.e. it would tell me where to turn when I was directly at the junction - not ideal if I&rsquo;m at speed!).  However, it worked fine other than that and got me to Welwyn, where I decided to head home via St Albans.</p>
<p>This time I wasn&rsquo;t so lucky with the water! Just outside St Albans, I had to go through a puddle that was up to the crankset of my bike. I ended up with wet feet but made it through intact. After that was fairly easy going.</p>
<p>Must add that I went down the cycletrack/footpath down the side of the A414 and I have to say it isn&rsquo;t the most fun road to cycle down but at least there is a cycle track there which makes it much safer to use. Means I can get across from St Alban&rsquo;s easier and that&rsquo;s a plus.</p>
<p>Anyhow, a nice easy ride to start the new year off with (and 2% of my annual goal target achieved!)</p>
