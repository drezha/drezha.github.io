			<p>This weekend I had initially planned to go on a ride with the London Brompton Club to Hove (starting at Richmond). However, a text from my parents meant that I ended up changing my plans, and headed out instead to Dorset for the weekend.</p>
<p>Complete change of plans and I something I hadn&rsquo;t planned for at all (I got the text at 15:00 on Friday afternoon, so I bought my train tickets online and headed to Waterloo at 17:00 when I finished!) Nothing like being a bit spontaneous I guess!</p>
<p>Getting the train down was easy enough - brief cycle from Kings Cross to Waterloo and then jump on a direct train. However, one thing I noted was that South West trains don&rsquo;t have a lot of luggage space (practically none - sort it out South West!) so I was concerned with where I was going to get to leave my Brompton. I needn&rsquo;t have worried to much.</p>

<p>Plenty of room in the disabled section (for bike and legs!) - obviously if it needed to be used, I&rsquo;d have moved. However, it meant that I could keep an eye on the bike all the way down.</p>
<h2 id="saturday">Saturday</h2>
<p>Most of the day was spent with the family at a food festival but I managed to get out and about in the afternoon and head to the coast. We were staying not far from the coast, so it wasn&rsquo;t a particularly strenuous ride. However, there was a bike hill separating me from the coast which was easy to get up one way, less so the other!</p>
<p>It gave a good view before descending into Lulworth though.</p>

<p>Then Lulworth Cove was a nice place to sit and visit for a while.</p>

<p>I got a few looks for turning up on the Brompton but I wouldn&rsquo;t change my trusty steed! Not many other bikes I could have just nipped on the train at rush hour with from London!</p>

<p>Played around with the <a href="https://www.photosynth.net/">Microsoft Photosynth</a> app on my new Nokia Lumia 920.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/113531214@N07/14296845277"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3856/14296845277_1478bb142a_z.jpg" alt="bbfdb7ea-698e-4958-be0f-7c6a6a0e6cad"></a></p>
<p>Seems to work reasonably well, but does seem to lose some details if you look closely. Not sure if that that&rsquo;s the camera, the app or the photographer!</p>
<p>The way back, I ended up cycling a bit further - I added on a loop. I wasn&rsquo;t quite finished riding and wanted to look around the area a bit. Nearby is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winfrith">Winfrith nuclear research site</a>, which is currently being decommissioned. There&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s always intrigued me about nuclear power and I enjoyed the adaption of STALKER - both the game and film (which are loosely based on the book <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadside_Picnic">Roadside Picnic</a></em> which <strong>isn&rsquo;t</strong> set in Chernobyl, the film and book are). So I couldn&rsquo;t resist a slightly closer look. The surrounding area was fairly desolate and I couldn&rsquo;t help but imagine similar scenes to STALKER itself (though, hopefully there was less radiation around me than in the game and Chernobyl/Pripyat itself!)</p>
<p>I stopped to get a picture at the top of a short, steep hill before heading onwards.</p>

<h2 id="sunday">Sunday</h2>
<p>Sunday saw the family head over to Weymouth for breakfast and a brief walk along the sea.</p>
<p>Turns out that we had arrived in time for the Veterans Day parade. I managed to get a few pictures, however, not many of them came out particularly well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/113531214@N07/14482052054"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5500/14482052054_de5be6cc51_z.jpg" alt="WP_20140622_004"></a></p>

<p>Not sure whether that&rsquo;s the case of the camera or the photographer as it was my new phone - the camera does have a dedicated button and I&rsquo;m trying to decide if that&rsquo;s the cause of it not focussing on the parts that I want. I&rsquo;ll just have to take more photos to find out!</p>
<p>Anyhow, it was a pleasant weekend and not one I would have expected to do!</p>
