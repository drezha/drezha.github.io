			<p>When I bought the Brompton, there was the option of upgrading the saddle to a Brooks saddle. I decided against on the basis that I would see how the standard Brompton saddle faired as the one on the test model I&rsquo;d ridden didn&rsquo;t seem to bad. I&rsquo;m also not a fan of the Brooks saddle - I didn&rsquo;t like the look.</p>
<p>So I stuck with the Brompton saddle for a few hundred miles and it didn&rsquo;t seem to bad at all. However, there was a saddle I had in mind - the <a href="http://www.chargebikes.com/parts-collection/spoon#">Charge Spoon</a>. The Spoon was a saddle I&rsquo;ve put many miles onto as I had one on my hybrid I bought years ago, moved that to my road bike and then moved it to the hybrid I bought in January. Overall, it&rsquo;s a really comfy saddle and so I thought it was perhaps time to move it to the Brompton.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the Brompton saddle is pretty good, but I knew that the Charge was like an old friend.</p>
<h2 id="mistake">Mistake</h2>
<p>Well, I ordered the Charge Spoon and put it on the Brompton. However, I soon realised my mistake. A week of commuting and a weekend ride of constant adjustments, I just couldn&rsquo;t get the saddle set up nicely. The weekends ride was enough really. I couldn&rsquo;t get it right - perhaps it&rsquo;s not suited to the Brompton but either way, everything I tried was to much of an issue.</p>
<p>So it looked like I was stuck with the Brompton saddle again. That was, until I saw that Brooks had released the <a href="http://brooksengland.co.uk/catalogue-and-shop/saddles/touring+%26+trekking/Cambium+C17/">Cambium</a> saddle in Slate. The Cambium I do like the look of - it looks like an actual saddle, compared to the standard Brooks saddle that looks like a saddle with wings… I&rsquo;d seen the Cambium before but it was originally released in a fairly awful looking straw colour which wasn&rsquo;t going to go anywhere near my bike.</p>
<p>I walked into the Brooks store in Covent Garden to buy it as it&rsquo;s a fairly new saddle and I wasn&rsquo;t able to get it in the Brompton Junction yet, so I cycled the short distance to the Brooks store.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve seen a Brooks product up close (well, exception is my multi tool - I bought the Brooks one in February at the London Bike Show) and was seriously impressed with the quality of it.</p>
<p>I purchased mine from the Brooks store in Covent Garden and it packaged nicely. You knew you were getting a premium product. However, as the Tweed Run was that weekend, they assumed I was getting it for that. Unfortunately, with no ticket for the Tweed Run, I was just buying it as I wanted it (and the Brompton Urban Challenge would be it&rsquo;s first outing on the Sunday).</p>
<h2 id="brompton---s-type">Brompton - S type</h2>
<p>Placing it on the Brompton was easy - benefit is that you can use any saddle on the Brompton. Like the Spoon before it, I have to mount the Cambium all the way at the top of the seatpost and have the seatpost extended all the way up to allow me to have a comfortable riding position. I&rsquo;m even using the extended seatpost.</p>

<p>My first ride with it was the Space for Cycling ride on the Saturday with the London Cycling Campaign and the CTC. On the ride, I was asked by a fair number of people what I thought of the saddle. It was a bit early to give an informed opinion!</p>
<p>That completed, I undertook the Brompton Urban Challenge on it. You can read my post on that <a href="http://ayearinbike.tumblr.com/post/86773554869/london-brompton-urban-challenge-2014">here</a>. Overall, I was impressed the saddle and it held up well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/113531214@N07/14214750654"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5117/14214750654_1c83cf44aa_z.jpg" alt="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5117/14214750654_1c83cf44aa_z.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Since then, I&rsquo;ve had a week or two of commuting on it and I&rsquo;ve been impressed. So impressed, I&rsquo;ve got another Brooks saddle…</p>
<h2 id="brooks-2---p-type-upgrade">Brooks 2 - P Type Upgrade</h2>
<p>The P type is my Brompton of choice for long distances. This is on the basis that the hand grips allow me a range of hand positions for the longer times in the saddle. It also has a lower gearing (the -12% or 44T &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo;) that can be fitted to the Brompton (on the basis that if I&rsquo;m cycling further, I want to cope with the hills more! - Mind, I coped ok on the London Classic of which, I regret I didn&rsquo;t blog about).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/113531214@N07/13827321423"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3678/13827321423_3a8a330b67_z.jpg" alt="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3678/13827321423_3a8a330b67_z.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Anyhow, on my last long distance ride to <a href="http://ayearinbike.tumblr.com/post/85315907189/hatfield-to-cambridge">Cambridge</a>, I thought that the bike could do with a new saddle. Likewise, after the second day of the Loughborough to Hatfield tour I did, the second day was fairly tender. So something had to be done.</p>
<p>Now having a Brooks saddle, I knew that it was comfy so that wasn&rsquo;t an issue. Nor was the cost - as a comfy saddle will be the best purchase I can make for the bike!</p>
<p>Anyhow, I&rsquo;d deliberately not got a B17 (the classic Brooks saddle) for my bike because I didn&rsquo;t like the &ldquo;wings&rdquo; that the saddles have.</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/r9ki1wC"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/r9ki1wC.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>I felt that these made the the saddle look silly and I didn&rsquo;t want that on my bike. However, the P type…</p>
<p>I think the P type already looks a bit silly. Well, maybe not silly, but it&rsquo;s certainly not going to win a good looks competition. And that&rsquo;s fine, because it&rsquo;s not there to do so - it&rsquo;s there to be a solid, dependable bike that I can rely on for touring. And in this role, Brooks apparently excel. With the comfort of the Cambium, I decided that ok, maybe the B17 could make an appearance on my bike (the plus side, it was cheaper than the Cambium as well…)</p>
<p>I fitted that this weekend and thought I&rsquo;d do a short test ride as I needed to proof the saddle (as it&rsquo;s leather, it needs looking after) and I&rsquo;d heard that an unbroken in saddle can be uncomfortable so I thought a small ride would be in order. However, it turned into a 46Km ride.</p>
<p>Not quite sure how that happened but I think I just kept going. Not bad after doing the morning trip to the shops.</p>
<p>Anyhow, once I&rsquo;d got the position right, the saddle seemed remarkably comfy straight off the bat. So I&rsquo;ll be using it a few more times (and proofing it tomorrow!). I think the next ride that I&rsquo;ll plan on using it is the Whitstable Winder that the London Brompton Club have planned for June. I plan to try and start with <a href="http://www.myorangebrompton.com/">Orange Brompton</a> and others at the 7am start for the longer ride option, rather than meet halfway for the 10:30 start. Just means getting a very early train…</p>
<p>Overall, so far the Brooks saddles have shown themselves to be decent saddles. I&rsquo;ll perhaps do another write up once I&rsquo;ve used them a lot more but currently hold out that I&rsquo;ll not have to buy a new saddle for quite a while (or a new bike for that matter!)</p>
