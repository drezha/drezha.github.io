			<p>So it&rsquo;s not been long since I&rsquo;ve had my Brompton - it arrived in February.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;ve already managed to add another one to my collection!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.welovebromptons.co.uk/">We Love Bromptons!</a> had a 2012 Blue P6R model up for sale recently at a decent price so I ended up getting it. It wasn&rsquo;t my initial plan to do so - I had been planning on touring on my hybrid this year but then when my house deal fell through, I had to move into rented accommodation quickly and wasn&rsquo;t able to get anywhere where I could store a full size bike. So unfortunately, I was forced to either abandon my plans for summer or to make some changes. So I ended up getting a new Brompton and adapting my plans!</p>
<p>The P type is the butterfly style handlebars, the 6 implies it has six gears and the R implies that the Brompton has a rack attached (as well as mudguards).</p>
<h2 id="differences">Differences</h2>
<p>You might ask why I couldn&rsquo;t simply use the existing Brompton for touring. After all, it&rsquo;s a six speed model as well and the simple answer is that I bought the wrong model.</p>
<p>Well, OK, that&rsquo;s not quite true - I bought the S6L and I love it to bits.</p>
<p>However, the S type Brompton cannot take the larger T bag that Brompton make (designed for touring, apparently) as the bag can interfere with the brakes on the S type handle bars (all other models are fine!). So, in fairness, I made the wrong choice of Brompton for touring, but for my day to day commute and for fun, the S type wins (it&rsquo;s the bike I think I&rsquo;ll be riding mostly with the London Brompton Club).</p>
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know the different handle bar types, see the image below:</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/B0ATvV9"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/B0ATvV9.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The S is clearly the lowest handlebars (well, other than the P type where the lower bars are as low, it not slightly lower, but don&rsquo;t have the brakes there to interfere with the bag when it&rsquo;s mounted on the luggage block).</p>
<p>So I could have added a rack to my S type and used the rack bag, but that didn&rsquo;t seem like a good idea, it would make my daily bike heavier for no benefit during the week. Also, the rack bag isn&rsquo;t as large as the T bag so I might have struggled to get everything in. Of course, I could have perhaps looked at third party solutions for the rack bag. Anyhow, I ended up getting a whole new Brompton as the P type I bought also came with a hub dynamo that I wouldn&rsquo;t have minded getting, as I wanted to try and get a charger for my phone off the hub.</p>
<p>Perhaps I might have gone for an M type (the normal Brompton bars) if I&rsquo;d have found a M6R about but I wasn&rsquo;t able to find one at a price I was willing to pay for a second hand model. In the end, the touring bars came out on top and when I found the second model available, I ended up splashing out.</p>
<p>In effect, the main difference between this and my daily commute is the ability to take the larger touring back. If I&rsquo;d gone for the M type, I might have been fine using it for all my days out. The benefit of hindsight. However, having two Bromptons means that I can let someone else borrow one for a ride at some point if needed and that if one ever has to go to the shop for whatever reason, I wont be bike less as I&rsquo;ll be able to make use of the other.</p>
<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve only had to make a few changes to the P type since getting it to ensure that it&rsquo;s ready to go - mainly the switch to the extended seat post. I&rsquo;ve also had to add the luggage block to allow me to take the Brompton bags. I&rsquo;ve also purchased the T bag, ready to go.</p>
<p>A few extras are to come, after my learning experiences at the weekend with the Brompton riders - these are a Camelbak for on the go hydration and a spanner of some kind for punctures.</p>
<h2 id="touring">Touring</h2>
<p>The reason I got the P type was for touring. It&rsquo;s first challenge will come on the 11th-13th April, where I will be planning to cycle from Loughborough (where I did my PhD) to Hatfield (where I live). I&rsquo;ll be cheating somewhat and staying at a hotel on the Saturday night but it was a case of a hotel for £19 or a campsite at only just slightly cheaper. I thought I&rsquo;d splash out a bit and get the hotel. Everything is pretty much all ready to go now, other than the few tools mentioned above that I&rsquo;ll need in case of mechanical issues. I need to test the P type to ensure that it&rsquo;s all working fine and no issues with it mechanically, otherwise I&rsquo;ll be fairly stuck. I&rsquo;ll be perhaps investigating some form of cycle breakdown cover. However, initial looks show that punctures don&rsquo;t seem to be included by default and that seems to be the hardest part of a six speed Brompton to fix!</p>
<h2 id="hermes">Hermes</h2>
<p>Following the tradition started with my MTB, the new Brompton will be named following a God from the pantheon of Gods of old. The S type Brompton is Loki, as a shape changer and a God of mischief. As the P type is for touring, I&rsquo;ve named it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes">Hermes</a>, after the messenger of the Greek Gods.</p>
