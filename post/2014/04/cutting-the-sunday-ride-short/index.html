			<p>So today I ended up going for a ride and aborted it early.</p>
<p>Partly due to the fact that I&rsquo;m still a bit saddle sore from last weekend - the Brompton turns out is pretty decent (I&rsquo;ve used it for about 60Km a ride before, see the data for the <a href="http://www.strava.com/activities/127537203">London Classic</a> and the LBC ride, the <a href="http://www.strava.com/activities/124985626">Thames Triple Chaser</a>). These rides were fine and the saddle performed fine. However, over the distance I rode last weekend and the partly gravelly nature of the route (I think), the saddle did end up causing some chafing and discomfort. Didn&rsquo;t help I wasn&rsquo;t wearing cycling shorts (well, padded shorts). So I thought a smallish ride today to ease back in.</p>
<p>However, whilst it started off well, things took a turn for the worst.</p>
<h2 id="ride">Ride</h2>
<p>I started off normally and headed down the Alban Way towards St Albans. I ended up taking a different route to get to Colney Heath and ended up going across a field.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/113531214@N07/13958583784"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5051/13958583784_6f6c6a907a_z.jpg" alt="Untitled"></a></p>

<p>Anyhow, once getting past Colney Heath, I continued on my and ended up powering up a hill and this appeared to be my downfall. Cresting the hill, I wanted to find somewhere to stop and take off my new wind layer that I&rsquo;d picked up from Regatta/Dare 2B on Friday (<a href="http://www.en.dare2b.com/mens/windshells/fired-up-windshell-black.html">this one</a>, though I got it for a smidge under £19, thanks to YHA discount and the cheaper in store prices!). When I stopped, I was overcome with feeling faint.</p>
<p>I had to sit down for a good couple of minutes, taking on water and trying not to fall onto the grass verge and lie down. I was sweating profusely and felt sick. Lightheaded as well until I say down on the kerb properly. However, stuck there, I was a distance from Hatfield and didn&rsquo;t really have any choice but to leisurely start heading home. I made sure to use quiet roads and then the NCN Route 12 when I could.</p>
<p>I felt much better on the way back at the more sedate pace and even stopped to get a panoramic of the rape fields.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not entirely sure what caused the issue - perhaps I was pushing it to hard, perhaps it was to do with hitting my head earlier in the morning or that I&rsquo;d eaten breakfast maybe less than an hour before hand. Either way, I was a bit put out and had to cut it short.</p>
<p>In fairness. getting in, I was beginning to feel the saddle was beginning to hurt again so it was probably a good distance to do. Least it got me out in the sun!</p>
<p>Hopefully, next weekend will see me back in the saddle properly with no more ill effects.</p>
