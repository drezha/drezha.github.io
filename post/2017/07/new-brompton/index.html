			<p>I’ve had my Brompton Loki for over three years now. It has served me well. However, it’s had a number of changes to it since owning it after I figured out what I wanted:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A dynamo and lights were fitted. The Shimano hub and lights have served me well, but made things easier in terms of lighting - I was never left without lights if I had gone out and I don’t have to worry about batteries at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The handlebars were replaced with mountain biking bars so that it was of a similar height to that of the M type.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, it’s done well. However, I’ve always regretted not getting the colour that I wanted when I purchased it and on occasion, I’ve missed not having a rack.</p>
<p>So, with a new job in Manchester, I decided that now would be the ideal time to upgrade, especially as I would be cycling to work on it daily.</p>
<h2 id="hermes">Hermes</h2>
<p>Hermes is the newest addition to the stable.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/113531214@N07/35614900716/in/dateposted-public/"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4116/35614900716_d6c5ba69c3_z.jpg" alt="2017-06-19 08.21.48"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a Brompton M6R. M type handle bars, 6 gears and a rear rack.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve named it Hermes - so, I&rsquo;ve had one called that before&hellip;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/113531214@N07/14683979427/in/dateposted-public/"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5584/14683979427_c4791aa586_z.jpg" alt="Untitled"></a></p>
<p>But then I rarely rode that one and I didn&rsquo;t keep it for very long. So I&rsquo;ve named this one Hermes.</p>
<h2 id="2017-brompton-model">2017 Brompton Model</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already noticed that there are some benefits to the 2017 version of the Brompton.</p>
<p>The new brake levers and gears are a massive improvement over the older gear levers. In fairness, the ability to upgrade these would be well worth doing on an older model.</p>
<p>The newer M type bar is OK - I&rsquo;ve not noticed a huge difference over the older versions that I tried, though it is a bit different to my MTB based one that I&rsquo;ve just left. However, I&rsquo;d say that it&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>
<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m impressed with it and I look forward to using it! Loki has now been retired from active service and has been sold off, so I&rsquo;m down to just this one. Looking forward to using it!</p>
