<h2 id="brooks-saddle">Brooks Saddle</h2>
<p>The first part I got hold of was a new saddle. I wasn&rsquo;t after one, but this came up for a price that was entirely reasonable so I decided to snap it up.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/113531214@N07/31524511454/in/dateposted-public/"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/659/31524511454_40785bab12_z.jpg" alt="2017-01-16 18.08.25"></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d been considering getting a <a href="http://www.brooksengland.com/en_uk/saddles/cambium.html">Brooks Cambium</a> saddle for the Verenti for a while - it was either that or a <a href="http://www.chargebikes.com/spoon/">Charge Spoon</a>. I&rsquo;ve a <a href="http://drezha.me.uk/2014/05/brooks-saddle/">Cambium on my Brompton</a> since they were released and I released that I wasn&rsquo;t going to get on with a Charge Spoon on my Brompton. If I was going to get one for the Verenti, I wanted it to be a black one to match the colour scheme, but this one was going for a song compared to brand new so I thought I&rsquo;d let the colour scheme suffer for a bit.</p>
<p>The Spoon is what I&rsquo;ve got on my Dawes and it&rsquo;s the same saddle I&rsquo;ve had for quite a while. I think I&rsquo;ve moved it from my first bike I bought from when I got my first bike after years off the bike back in 2011. It&rsquo;s been extremely comfortable, with the exception of my Brompton. I&rsquo;ve used it on road and off road and it&rsquo;s performed excellently in each type. Now that I see that they offer a camo version of the Spoon, I might have to reconsider my Brooks purchase&hellip;.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.alpkit.com">Alpkit</a> are an outdoor equipment designer and retailer. I&rsquo;ve purchased a few items them recently and I&rsquo;ve been incredibly impressed with the price and quality of the items they have.</p>
<p>For my Dawes, I have a Carradice <a href="http://www.carradice.co.uk/bags/saddlebags/super-c-audax-saddlebag">Super C Audax Saddlebag</a> that I carry around my puncture repair kit and assorted other items I may take out on a ride (though I&rsquo;m beginning to think that a rack bag might be a better option for the Dawes). I&rsquo;ve nothing that&rsquo;s similar on the Verenti, so I decided to get myself an <a href="https://www.alpkit.com/products/fuel-pod-medium">Alpkit Fuel Pod</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/113531214@N07/31524509904/in/dateposted-public/"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/477/31524509904_0ce50a7a74_z.jpg" alt="2017-01-16 18.08.33"></a></p>
<p>This will let me hold my keys and/or phone to hand in case I need it for whatever reason.</p>
<p>However, since putting this on, I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://drezha.me.uk/2017/02/sunday-ride-a-few-photos-and-a-puncture/">done a ride</a> with the bag on and I&rsquo;ve come to the conclucsion that I wont get on with it - at least not on this bike. It was geting in the way slightly when I would have to get off the saddle to get up hills.</p>
<h2 id="final-product">Final Product</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve a few extra bits that I&rsquo;ve purchased that have yet to make it onto the bike as well - I&rsquo;ve got some mudgaurds that need fitting and I&rsquo;ve new pedals (platforms, as I&rsquo;m moving away from the cleats). They&rsquo;ll be fitted when I have the time to do so.</p>
