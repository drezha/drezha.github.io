			<p>I managed to get out this morning for a short ride on my cyclocross bike - it&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve ridden it as I&rsquo;m using my Dawes touring bike for commuting and I haven&rsquo;t had the chance to get out at the weekend for a while due to cadet activities.</p>
<p>So whilst the weather was good this morning, I managed to get out and about before the rain that was forecast for the afternoon. Whilst I didn&rsquo;t manage to avoid the rain completely, it was a mainly dry ride and I&rsquo;m glad I managed to get out.</p>
<p>As I said, took Atlas out for a spin. I&rsquo;ve recently purchased a few items for it that are covered in a separate blog post and I was looking to try them out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/113531214@N07/32595719145/in/dateposted-public/"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/491/32595719145_14120c7e8d_z.jpg" alt="2017-01-29 10.17.27 HDR"></a></p>
<p>I also decided that I wanted to get out and about on some unpaved routes as well to put the cyclo-cross part of the bike to the test. Whilst it did mean some road riding as well, I was able to get back on some trails that I haven&rsquo;t ridden for a good while - not since I had my mountain bike and lived closer to them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/113531214@N07/32472721851/in/dateposted-public/"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/410/32472721851_dfc12a622a_z.jpg" alt="2017-01-29 10.17.38 HDR"></a></p>
<p>The ride was cut slighty short by the fact that I got a puncture - oddly, not whilst I was doing the off road section of the ride but later, during the road section when I was starting to head back home anyhow! It meant that I had to cut my ride slightly short as I then ended up taking the faster route back home to avoid any further issues.</p>
<p>Changing the tube at the side of the ride, I found a slither of glass inside the tube that had caused the puncture - I can&rsquo;t be certain whether this was what had caused the earlier puncture but I hadn&rsquo;t fully removed the cause or not. However, the wet roads actually helped me find the cause - the bubbling water on the tyre as the air escaped betrayed the punctures position!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/113531214@N07/31751913244/in/dateposted-public/"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/444/31751913244_2089cdb863_z.jpg" alt="2017-01-29 10.17.35"></a></p>
<p>Repairing the puncture, I headed home. Of all the cyclists that went past, only one slowed and asked if I was OK. In general, I&rsquo;ve had better help in the past. I mean, if there&rsquo;s a group of cyclists, I wouldn&rsquo;t stop to offer a hand unless they looked like they really needed it, but I&rsquo;m surprised that more people didn&rsquo;t ask if a single cyclist was OK. It turns out that it wasn&rsquo;t that much of an issue sorting the puncture so I wasn&rsquo;t to bad.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;ll keep an eye on the tyres. That&rsquo;s two in less than four months - that&rsquo;s two more than I&rsquo;ve had in the past 12 months on my previous bikes! It may mean I have to look into some thicker, more puncture proof tyres!</p>
<p>In terms of how everything performed&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that I&rsquo;m no longer a huge fan of being clipped in. That might be different if I was just doing road riding or was off road on a proper mountain bike, but I wasn&rsquo;t to keen on it on this one. Not being able to put my foot down if I wanted to in a hurry wasn&rsquo;t good. Also, it requires some more playing to get my foot position right I think without it aching. I think flats would be the best replacement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bar bag isn&rsquo;t in a good location, especially when hill climbing. I&rsquo;d wanted it there for somewhere I could store my keys/wallet/phone but I think I&rsquo;ll be replacing it. It might be better on a longer frame bike or one where I won&rsquo;t be standing on the pedals to climb hills much. I&rsquo;ve recently purchased a rack bag for my Dawes, so I&rsquo;m looking at removing the saddlebag and placing it on this one instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to have to have to get used to riding off road again! And hills!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, it was a good ride and I enjoyed it (even with the puncture). I&rsquo;ve got a few things to change before I&rsquo;m 100% happy with the ride (such as changing the pedals and changing the luggage options). Hopefully, I&rsquo;ll be able to get out on the bike a bit more as the weather begins (slowly) to start improving.</p>
