			<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve sold my Mac and have been relying on Windows and Linux - almost a year has gone by since I got rid of the MacBook Pro. I&rsquo;ve not really missed it since it&rsquo;s been gone. In general, I&rsquo;ve been well served by my Windows gaming rig and my Lenovo X220 laptop running Xubuntu.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;ve tended to prefer open source software and my Xubuntu laptop. I&rsquo;ve taken to using LibreOffice more than Microsoft Word and I&rsquo;ve taken to using other open source apps, like <a href="http://www.gnucash.org/">GNUCash</a>, <a href="http://zim-wiki.org/">Zim</a>, <a href="https://www.keepassx.org/">KeepassX</a> (and <a href="http://keepass.info/">Keepass</a>) and <a href="https://www.clementine-player.org/">Clementine</a>. I&rsquo;ve not really had any issues using these over the commercial apps that I used to use.</p>
<p>I did have some issues previously - for example, getting Zim working on the Mac was a right pain and in the end it was part of the reason that drove me away (I was using Zim for some revision and I replaced <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/">Day One</a> with as my journaling software 1 when Day One went to a proprietary sync solution which meant it was harder to backup and wasn&rsquo;t supported on Android). However, in general, it&rsquo;s been rare for me to think &ldquo;<em>Boy, I wish I still had my Mac</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="icloud">iCloud</h2>
<p>Perhaps that is, until today. I tried to use LibreOffice and then Excel to try and setup a tracker (well, a table) so I could track my required Continuing Professional Development hours. My profession requires me to undertake 25 hours a year training and the easiest method of this seems to be the creation of a table and adding new items to it as and when needed.</p>
<p>However, I was put off by the results of both Excel and LibreOffice. Whilst I wasn&rsquo;t expecting much from LibreOffice (it works, but nothing it produces could be considered other than functional really - it isn&rsquo;t one for prettiness, at least not without some work), I was at least expecting Excel to produce something reasonable but it seems like I was mistaken.</p>

<p>It was at this point that I realised that Numbers would give me a decent enough table - but with no access to a Mac, I thought I&rsquo;d be relegated to using my iPad and having tried to use Excel and Google Sheets on my iPad, this didn&rsquo;t fill me with joy. Thankfully, iCloud is online as well, so I can make the document I need online via the iCloud website.</p>
<p>There was some initially some issues - iCloud doesn&rsquo;t like Linux and complains that it isn&rsquo;t supported (but seems to work fine). Windows has no such issues - at least not if you use a supported broswer. Currently using <a href="https://vivaldi.com">Vivaldi</a>, and whilst it&rsquo;s not on the supported list, as it uses Chrome as the base, it doesn&rsquo;t generate a not supported message.</p>

<p>Using Numbers online hasn&rsquo;t proven to be to much different to using Numbers on the Mac. Yes, it&rsquo;s not quite as nice as using the Mac version, but it gets the job done and I don&rsquo;t have to use it on the iPad. I believe the version on iCloud is slightly cut back when compared to that of the Mac version, but for the simple table that I&rsquo;ve needed to create, it hasn&rsquo;t been an issue.</p>
<h2 id="iwork">iWork</h2>
<p>In fact, using the Numbers online again has brought back reminders as to how good the iWork suite actually is. Whilst Pages has a number of limitations when compared to Microsoft Word that&rsquo;s meant that I didn&rsquo;t use it much (a lack of referencing support made it difficult for using it for for academic reports), Numbers and certainly Keynote give Microsoft a run for their money. In fact, I prefer Keynote for presentation creation - Powerpoint feels quite far behind in comparison. However, Numbers isn&rsquo;t going to give Excel nightmares when it comes to serious number crunching, but for general day to day use without macros, it performs well and I&rsquo;ve not really had any issues.</p>
<p>There are a number of apps that I do miss from the Mac days - 1Password on Windows is a poor shadow of its Mac counterpart which is a shame, whilst Windows and Linux are also missing any serious markdown editors - Ulyssess is a fantastic app and something similar doesn&rsquo;t seem to exist on the other operating systems unless you use something like Simplenote online. I tend to run all my blog posts through Ulyssess on my iPad before posting as it can tidy up any code that I write in <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> on the desktops.</p>
<p>A side effect of using Numbers today is that I&rsquo;ve found myself defaulting back to the Mac keyboard shortcuts! Yet, I&rsquo;ve found that I&rsquo;ve moved a personal finance spreadsheet back into iCloud because the method of using tables in Numbers suits the creation of lots of little tables, rather than the enforced grid layout of Excel/LibreOffice.</p>
<p>It may come to pass that I&rsquo;ll start using it more often over the coming months for various other items as well. I can&rsquo;t pretend that the auto sync doesn&rsquo;t come in handy as well, though without a Mac, backing up the files is restricted to manual downloads of a file, which perhaps isn&rsquo;t ideal.</p>
