			<p>I picked up a new toy for my bike this past week. My Dawes bike hasn&rsquo;t had a bell on it, probably since I bought the bike. It came with one, but it&rsquo;s pretty poor bell that the bike came with (something cheap and nasty that the bike has to be sold with in the UK). It just about works. Nothing special.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I&rsquo;ve been using the bike for a while now but I&rsquo;ve not had a bell on it and this can get annoying - riding to work, the majority of the route is along a shared path and it means that I can&rsquo;t warn people that I&rsquo;m coming up behind them.</p>
<p>So I decided that I needed to get a new bell and so I had a look around. I eventually settled on a Crane Sakura bell.</p>
<p><img src="http://vox.me.uk/images/2016-03-20%2011.33.08.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d considered getting the one of the <a href="http://www.lionbellworks.co.uk">Lion Works bells</a> but it seemed that they might be a little large for what I was thinking and the alternative one I was looking at, the <a href="http://www.spurcycle.com">Spurcycle bell</a> was just a bit to pricey.</p>
<p>I decided that the brass Crane bell would do the job and I ordered from <a href="https://www.velovitality.co.uk">Velo Vitality</a>. It wasn&rsquo;t a shop I&rsquo;d ordered from in the past, but I was very impressed with the service. The bell was sent on the same day I ordered and was shipped via Second Class Recorded (which did mean a few days delay whilst I had to go to the post office to get it but rather this than go to a courier location!) I&rsquo;d happily recommend them again and I&rsquo;ll keep an eye on their website (they&rsquo;re based in Brighton with a store just near the station apparently).</p>
<p>Anyhow, I fitted it this weekend to Odin finally.</p>
<p><img src="http://vox.me.uk/images/2016-03-20%2011.50.48.jpg" alt="Crane bell fitted to Odin"></p>
<p>I had no trouble installing it, even though the standard bars that Dawes installed on the bike have quite a slope. Ideally, I&rsquo;ll get an old inner tube and create an inner for the attachment because at the minute, the bell is metal against metal which isn&rsquo;t ideal but does work.</p>
<p>All I need to do now is to get out on the bike again!</p>
