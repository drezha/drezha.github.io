			<p>This weekend finally saw me get the chance to ride my new bike.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d made use of the Cycle to Work offer that my firm offer through <a href="https://www.cyclescheme.co.uk">Cyclescheme</a>. The offer allows me to save money on the purchase of a new bike through tax savings - I&rsquo;ve never really been hugely convinced that the deal saves me money (though I&rsquo;m assured that it does), but it is a method of getting a new bike with interest free credit for 12 months.</p>
<p>I suppose I didn&rsquo;t really need a new bike, but I&rsquo;d been looking at getting a new one - I had set my heart on getting a new Brompton. I&rsquo;d planned it out and everything. It was going to be British Racing Green and it was going to be <em>exactly</em> the same as my current Brompton.</p>
<p>After a bit of thought, I realised how stupid that was! I was essentially going to replace a perfectly good Brompton because I wanted one in a different colour… Common sense won out in the end and I didn&rsquo;t get the new Brompton!</p>
<h2 id="new-bike">New Bike</h2>
<p>However, I did end getting a new bike (otherwise I wouldn&rsquo;t be writing a blog post about one if I hadn&rsquo;t!)</p>
<p>I was looking around at various bikes and wasn&rsquo;t going to get one until I browsed Wiggle and had been talking with a friend. He&rsquo;d purchased a Wiggle own brand bike the year before on the scheme and was very impressed.</p>
<p>I gave it a ride and must admit, I was impressed. When I saw this years version, I ended up being converted! British Racing Green… I couldn&rsquo;t say no!</p>

<h2 id="getting-the-bike">Getting the bike</h2>
<p>Long winded story but I eventually got the bike after some administrative delays on behalf of the Cycle Scheme and the finance department and then IT issues at Wiggle. However, the bike arrived and I was able to get out on it eventually after replacing the pedals.</p>
<p>I even managed to make use of the work stand that I purchased a year or two ago and haven&rsquo;t really used up until now. That seemed to work perfectly fine.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/113531214@N07/25348073029/in/dateposted-public/"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/6/5643/25348073029_971e2d8ecb_z.jpg" alt="2016-10-08 11.15.00"></a></p>
<p>With the work stand, I was able to put together the new bike and put the pedals - with the cyclocross bike, I decided to go back to using cleats, so I installed the cleats and purchased a set of Giro Rumble shoes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/113531214@N07/30948473406/in/dateposted-public/"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/6/5334/30948473406_98705ea3c7_z.jpg" alt="2016-10-08 11.53.41"></a></p>
<h2 id="first-ride-and-naming">First Ride and Naming</h2>
<p>So once the pedals were on, I had to wait until the next day before taking it out for a ride - tantamount to torture!</p>
<p>However, I managed to get out on the bike the next day - it was a nice day and was ideal cycling weather as it was sunny, but not to warm.</p>
<p>At this point, I hadn&rsquo;t named my bike - those that follow me on Strava or my blog must know that my bikes all have names. Most of them are named after Norse Gods - currently I have Odin, my Dawes Touring bike and Loki, my Brompton.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/113531214@N07/30867465032/in/dateposted-public/"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5732/30867465032_a049e86ab8_z.jpg" alt="2016-10-10 21.27.00"></a></p>
<p>Not named after a Norse god (that I know of!) is Scarlet, my Pashley Parabike. This was names Scarlet after the bike that I rode in Berlin for my <a href="http://www.vox.me.uk/post/2015/04/cycling-in-berlin/">tour of Berlin</a> and I fell in love with it.</p>
<p>So what was I to name this one? I&rsquo;d been thinking about it but couldn&rsquo;t decide.</p>
<p>That was until I was out riding and the name came to me.</p>
<p>So I present to you, Atlas.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/113531214@N07/22805424518/in/dateposted-public/"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/6/5542/22805424518_909fdcfa0a_z.jpg" alt="2016-10-09 10.31.46 HDR-1"></a></p>
<p>An odd name perhaps, though, it is in keeping with the mythology theme, as a Greek titan responsible for holding up the world.</p>
<p>And the name came about due to the Ayn Rand book, &ldquo;<em>Atlas Shrugged</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/113531214@N07/30948513756/in/dateposted-public/"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/6/5632/30948513756_2a4f8cafe3_n.jpg" alt="2016-10-10 21.55.35"></a></p>
<p>It seemed to me that the bike was able to &ldquo;shrug&rdquo; off anything that I threw at it on the ride - be that road, grass or gravel track (and even some Sustrans paths). It performed excellently on all of them, so the name Atlas stuck!</p>
<p>Ride wise, the bike performed really well and is excellent to ride. I didn&rsquo;t adjust anything for this ride - I seemed to have got the bars in the right location and the seat height seemed to be ok. Future work may look at seeing if I can bring the brake levers in a bit closer to the grips and I may change the saddle in the future but for now, it seems to be pretty good.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Bit early to draw conclusions yet but so far, it seems to be a good purchase. I&rsquo;m liking riding a drop bar bike again - I thought I wouldn&rsquo;t when I bought the Dawes but actually this isn&rsquo;t bad at all. I might consider some cross top brakes, as I quite like the upright riding position at times but that&rsquo;ll come in the future with some further testing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to ride a bike that&rsquo;s lighter than all my other bikes - I think the lightest bike I had until this one arrived was the Brompton and that&rsquo;s over 13Kg. Wiggle has this one as 11.4Kg but it feels lighter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to giving it some miles.</p>
