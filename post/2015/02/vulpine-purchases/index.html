			<p>I was lucky enough last week to get a chance to visit the Vulpine sample sale. <a href="http://www.vulpine.cc/">Vulpine</a> are a British gear manufacturer that make stylish clothes that appear to rival <a href="http://www.rapha.cc/">Rapha</a> in quality. When it was posted on the London Brompton Club Facebook page, I thought I&rsquo;d get myself over there for a look.</p>
<h2 id="vulpine">Vulpine</h2>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t manage to get there until the evening. I got there about 17:00, having left work slightly early to see what was left. I&rsquo;d been following on Facebook with how much things had cost etc with the other LBC members who&rsquo;d been attending during the day so I decided to give it a go - after all, the rain jackets and the <a href="http://www.vulpine.cc/Shop/Mens/Jackets-Gilets/ICAT1000/MENS-HARRINGTON-RAIN-JACKET/ITM1127">Harrington jacket</a> I&rsquo;d been keeping my eye on for a while were down from £195 to £60 (approximately a 70% reduction!)</p>
<p><img src="http://vox.me.uk/share/DSCF0362.JPG" alt="Harrington Jacket"></p>
<p>As such, I wasn&rsquo;t surprised to find that there wasn&rsquo;t to much left! I browsed what was left but managed to find myself one of the last Harrington jackets in my size! Not the colour I would have chosen if all the colours are there, but I still think it&rsquo;s a decent colour and therefore I considered it worth getting.</p>

<p>I also managed to purchase myself a merino wool, long sleeve polo shirt. I&rsquo;ve bought merino wool jumpers before - I&rsquo;d got one from Mountain Warehouse. However, I found it to be itchy and caused more irritation than I wanted and so I moved back to synthetic jerseys. However, I&rsquo;d heard good things about the Vulpine ones and as they had some there reduced, I decided to risk getting one. Besides, I thought, I could stick in on eBay if I didn&rsquo;t get on with it. However, I can&rsquo;t show you an image of it as it&rsquo;s in the wash! It&rsquo;s been really comfortable and I&rsquo;m surprised at just how comfortable it is! It seems that pricey merino wool is certainly worth the money (and as this was £25, that was a bargain).</p>
<p>I had been waiting to see if there were any bargains at the London Bike Show next week but I think this just solved that issue!</p>
<p>The benefits of having the Vulpine gear is that, whilst aimed at cycling, it&rsquo;s a lot more laid back than wearing lycra. This means I can happily wear the jacket at work and casually and people don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s a cycling specific make particularly. It should come in handy if I do more touring this year.</p>
<h2 id="castelli-gloves">Castelli Gloves</h2>
<p>I purchased a while ago, a pair of Castelli neoprene gloves. I did a brief look at them <a href="http://ayearinbike.tumblr.com/post/106925370574/new-purchases-and-ride">here</a> and I wore them for the <a href="http://ayearinbike.tumblr.com/post/108271842619/evans-ride-it-osterley">Evans Ride It</a> ride. However, after the ride, I took them back to Evans. They&rsquo;d been used for probably about 100Km in total, but I noticed that there was already a hole forming where the thumb meets the main part of the glove. Considering the price of the gloves, I wasn&rsquo;t to happy with that and I returned them to Evans. They sent them off for a warranty claim and I received a full refund the week after.</p>
