			<p>So work recently bought me an iPhone as my work phone. Whilst I&rsquo;m happy with this (as much as I like Android, I find iOS to be better), it has led to a few head scratching moments.</p>
<p>Namely, as an Apple user for a fair amount of time, I&rsquo;ve purchased a fair amount of apps on the App Store that I want to use on the work phone, but I&rsquo;m hampered by the fact it&rsquo;s linked to a new AppleID, one created with my work email.</p>
<p>Turns out it&rsquo;s no problem - just enable family sharing and off I go! I&rsquo;ve been able to download most of my previous apps with a few exceptions as family sharing has to be enabled by the developer.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://appsto.re/gb/IPUR2.i">Transmit</a> seems to be the only app I use a lot that isn&rsquo;t family sharing enabled. This does mean that I can&rsquo;t really use my own sharing system for images</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://appsto.re/gb/NAm6H.i">1Password</a> switched to a in app purchase model which means my purchase hasn&rsquo;t been associated with my new work AppleID and therefore I can&rsquo;t access the premium features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>iTunes Match isn&rsquo;t enabled for family sharing so to use music, I&rsquo;ll have to use something like Google Music or Spotify. Or only add my purchased music from the cloud (yes, I could use iTunes to sync music but really?)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping that family sharing isn&rsquo;t breaching my work terms of service for the phone (best check Monday) but I don&rsquo;t think so as all it&rsquo;s doing is linking my own purchases to my new phone. It thinks that my work phone is one of my family members, which technically, it&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p>Setting it up was a doddle - just input the family sharing information on my iPad and I was ready to go after an email verification.</p>
<h2 id="cloud-storage">Cloud Storage</h2>
<p>The perks of cloud storage crop again in this instance. I use <a href="https://appsto.re/gb/A7wlw.i">YNAB</a> and <a href="https://appsto.re/gb/ESRiz.i">Day One</a> a lot, both with Dropbox sync. By adding the Dropbox app and downloading the apps (both via family sharing), I was able to connect to both my budget and diary that I already had, regardless of what AppleID I&rsquo;m using. Extremely handy as now I can update both where ever I am and with what device I have to hand and both will sync back to my device.</p>
<p>Obviously, syncing between iCloud is going to be more of an issue because I&rsquo;ve not got the same AppleID but then, it&rsquo;s not much that I use on the iPad and iPhone that need to sync with that so I don&rsquo;t have to worry to much about that.</p>
