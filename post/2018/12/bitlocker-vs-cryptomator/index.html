			<p>I carry around a USB drive with me - usually a Sandisk Ultra USB, but occasionally a SSD drive<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. It usually comes in handy, as I either want to carry around my documents and images or need to transfer files between devices. However, the most common use, is for work files so that I can edit/continue working whilst I&rsquo;m away from the office and I cannot connect to the VPN or to overcome the poor VPN speeds.</p>
<p>I take a lot of photos whilst doing site visits and then have to put those in to reports at a later date, so accessing these over the VPN can be a right pain and therefore working locally (and then syncing via FreeFileSync at a later date) is usually the best option. However, I don&rsquo;t really want to be carrying around work files on a USB in case I lose it. Whilst I don&rsquo;t generally work on anything fancy or requiring security, I still have a responsibility to my clients not to mishandle the information.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I generally encrypt the portable drives using Bitlocker and use that, as the work laptop uses Windows and therefore I should have no issues.</p>
<p>Except I ran in to one last night. When I encrypted the drive itself, I chose the new Windows encryption method. After all, I was going to use it on my work laptop and this had the latest version of Windows 10 installed, so I&rsquo;d be fine right? Well, I forgot this, so when I tried to move some files between PC&rsquo;s at my local air cadet unit last night, I ran in to issues thanks to the laptops running Windows 7. Great. Simple to sort out, it just requires that I reformat the drive and then re-encrypt using the older Bitlocker version. However, before I gave this a go, I thought I&rsquo;d investigate the cross platform alternative of <a href="https://cryptomator.org/">Cryptomator</a>. It&rsquo;s designed to encrypt files to upload to the cloud, but there is no reason why it wouldn&rsquo;t work with the USB drive.</p>
<p>Unlike Bitlocker which encrypts the whole drive, Cryptomator encrypts individual files, very similar to EncFS. This means that I can encrypt the files I need to whilst leaving the rest of the files untouched. It also works on Windows and Linux so I&rsquo;m not limited to what system I try and access it on at home.</p>
<p>The first test was to benchmark the drive without any encryption at all. This was done with <a href="https://crystalmark.info/en/software/crystaldiskmark/">Crystalmark</a>. It&rsquo;s not a hugely scientific test, as I was running the drive off an <a href="https://www.anker.com/products/variant/3-port-usb-3-0-hub-with-ethernet-converter/A7522012">Anker USB 3 hub with ethernet</a> as the laptop doesn&rsquo;t have great Wifi connection in my office.</p>
<p><img src="https://vox.me.uk/images/2018-12-11%2009_48_14-Drevo-SSD.png" alt="Drevo SSD - No encryption"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not entirely sure how the write speeds are being quicker than the read speeds as that doesn&rsquo;t make much sense. However, it works and that&rsquo;s a benchmark figure.</p>
<p>Next, I added the folder to use Cryptomator and re-ran the results, pointing the benchmark test to the encrypted folder, which should then give the value for accessing the file system.</p>
<p><img src="https://vox.me.uk/images/2018-12-11%2009_59_00-Drevo-SSD-Cryptomater.png" alt="Drevo SSD - With Cryptomator"></p>
<p>Cryptomator accesses the files over a WebDAV connection. I could potentially speed up the access by using a third party WebDAV client, as the Windows explorer WebDAB implementation isn&rsquo;t ideal but the in built one requires no faff.</p>
<p>Lastly, I wiped the drive and put Bitlocker on and re-ran the benchmark again.</p>
<p><img src="https://vox.me.uk/images/2018-12-11%2011_05_38-Drevo-SSD-Bitlocker.png" alt="Drevo SSD - With Bitlocker"></p>
<p>Not to bad. Some differences between the raw benchmark and the Bitlocker run. I&rsquo;m not sure how the tests got a faster write speed under Bitlocker than not, but as I said, it&rsquo;s not a completely scientific test, so I might have had more data over the ethernet in the first test.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This shows that there is a drop in speeds between Bitlocker and no Bitlocker. However, it also shows that the Cryptomator has a greater drop off in speeds in comparison. However, it has the perk that I don&rsquo;t have to encrypt the full drive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be sticking with Bitlocker for now, but it&rsquo;s nice to know that I can still use Cryptomator for whatever I need to.</p>

<p>I use an <a href="https://www.aukey.com/products/usb-3-0-external-hard-drive-enclosure-ds-b4-1">Aukey USB 3</a> enclosure and a <a href="https://www.drevo.net/product/storage/x1-ssd">Drevo 240GB SSD</a>.
