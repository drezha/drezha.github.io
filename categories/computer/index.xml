      <title>Matias Quiet Pro Keyboard</title>

      <description>I’ve been playing about with new keyboards over the last few months - my most recent purchase is the Matias Quiet Pro for the Mac.
This is an American layout board that works with Bluetooth on the Mac and has a Mac based layout. It uses quiet Alps based keyswitches, rather than any of the Cherry MX or Cherry based knockoffs.
Quality The device feels sturdy enough when being used. However, there are some aspects that make it feel a bit cheaper than it should.</description>

      <description>I’ve got a Mac Mini and this is hooked up to a LG 27UL850-W and Dell S2421NX monitor. They’re both setup on my desk, with the LG as my main monitor and the Dell as a secondary monitor off to the side.
When using the desktop, I’ve always missed the ability to adjust the screen brightness easily within macOS using the keyboard, like you can on the MacBook and generally any Windows laptop.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been mixing macOS and Windows for a number of years. This hasn&amp;rsquo;t normally proved to be problematic in any way and I&amp;rsquo;ve had the best of both worlds.
One program that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t live with out on the Mac is Alfred. Alfred is a keyboard launcher, allowing you to start and run programs using a key combination and not having to move away from the keyboard. It also provides a quick calculation tool, which allows you to undertake calculations quickly.</description>

      <description>I had ditched Ulysses when it went subscription but during 2020, I’d paid for the subscription as I’d managed to get a discount code for it. It was good to be able to use it across my devices and it’s still one of the best plain text editors in my view - however, I don’t view it as being worth almost £50 a year - consider that Microsoft charge £60 for Office plus storage space, whereas Ulysses makes use of iCloud space to sync, so I’m not even paying them for syncing!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d been looking at my email clients on the Mac for using with Hook. I like the ability to link any previous email, as it helps me link to emails I&amp;rsquo;ve received or sent within my Obsidian notebook, and to be honest, it&amp;rsquo;s paid off a number of times now where it was quicker to look for the specific email that I&amp;rsquo;d linked in my Obsidian notebook, rather than search for the email I needed.</description>

      <description>With lockdown continuing in the UK, and working from home, I decided to look once more at the mechanical keyboard market.
I had been using the Logitech K350 on Windows without any issues, but for whatever reason, I wasn’t able to use this nicely on the Mac - I’d often get drop outs or lag, where what I was typing wasn’t picked up, or was lost completely 1.
In the mean time, I’d been using a Windows Dell keyboard - a cheap and cheerful keyboard that did the job, and I actually wasn’t getting RSI by using it!</description>

      <title>Performance per Watt</title>

      <guid>http://vox.me.uk/post/2021/04/performance-per-watt/</guid>
      <description>I wanted to compare the performance per watt of the new M1 Mac mini against that of my Ryzen 1600X powered gaming PC. To throw some additional items in there, I also measured my Ryzen 4300U little Windows office PC as well and my Raspberry Pi 4.
The speed of the new M1 Mac has shown that Apple’s move to Apple Silicon has been a good move for them. Benchmarks show that it’s faster than some of the Intel and AMD machines.</description>

      <description>I’d posted about my QNAP TR-002 previously and how I was using it as direct attached storage for my Mac. Recently, I moved it to the PC to use it as storage for gaming, as I’d switched my Mac external storage to a Samsung T7 external drive.
For the gaming rig, I added a second 3TB drive to the TR-002 and used reformatted to NTFS. RAID 0 should give me some additional speeds over the storage I was currently using.</description>

      <title>FDS on the M1 Mac</title>

      <guid>http://vox.me.uk/post/2021/01/fds-m1-mac/</guid>
      <description>So whenever I get a new machine, I always run an FDS benchmark on it - purely for fun and comparative purposes. I’ll often run it, even on a machine that isn’t likely to run FDS in a normal situations, such as the M1T Mini PC and Raspberry Pi.
So with the M1 Mac Mini, there was no reason not to run the benchmarks as well. However, as the M1 Mac is based on an ARM based chip, I wasn’t expecting it to perform that well - after all, it would be running on the Mac using Rosetta 2, as FDS is compiled for x86 processors1.</description>

      <title>Synology Issues</title>

      <guid>http://vox.me.uk/post/2021/01/synology-issues/</guid>
      <description>I ran in to some issues with my Synology over the Christmas period, involving BTRFS and RAID.
I had been running the NAS with an 8TB hard drive for main storage and a 3TB drive aimed at backups. However, I’d noticed a lot of a files deleted a few weeks ago which made me uneasy and then recently I found a corrupt image file on my gaming rig.
I wasn’t sure if this was the fault of the desktop, or the Synology, but when I investigated the Synology, I found that the BTRFS file system I was using to help protect against bit rot wasn’t actually protecting me at all.</description>

      <guid>http://vox.me.uk/post/2021/01/qnap-tr-002-das/</guid>
      <description>With the recent purchase of the Mac Mini, I needed to have an external drive - partly for Time Machine backups and partly as I only went 256GB internal drive. I’d got a couple of 2.5” hard drive caddies lying around, but also a 3.5” drive that wasn’t being used. Teamed up with the reduced number of ports on the M1 Mac Mini, I decided that I’d purchase a Direct Attached Storage (DAS) device for the Mac.</description>

      <description>After the issues I’ve had previously with the Mac, I wasn’t sure I was going to get another Mac. But I did.
I watched the M1 release keynote after it had finished and was impressed with what I saw. If it was true. However, after hanging around the Mac Power Users forum, I’d seen some interesting Mac apps that I fancied giving a go - things like Hook. I also wanted to continue using Photos, as I hadn’t really found an alternative on Windows that really matched it.</description>

      <guid>http://vox.me.uk/post/2020/12/insync/</guid>
      <description>My current job sees me using Onedrive as the primary storage location for files, and since the initial lockdown in the UK, we moved to using Microsoft Teams and storing data in Teams instead, rather than our on site servers and mapped hard drives.
This took some getting used to but suited me, as it meant that I could use my Mac Mini at home to access the files and work, rather than a work machine, which was good, as I had forgone the standard laptops that everyone else used so I could have an iPad for carrying out my risk assessments on, but this obviously isn&amp;rsquo;t as good for general office tasks1!</description>

      <title>Motion and Live Photos</title>

      <description>Apple&amp;rsquo;s Live Photos and Android equivalent, Motion Photos, initially seemed a bit like a gimmick when they were announced. However, there are a number of times now where the Live Photos on the iPhone has been of good use - mainly to capture amusing antics before or after the photo occurred!
With playing with Android, I was surprised that this didn&amp;rsquo;t appear to have the same. However, after some googling, I discovered it does, and it&amp;rsquo;s called Motion Photos.</description>

      <guid>http://vox.me.uk/post/2020/11/benchmarking-arm/</guid>
      <description>There has been much talk on how well ARM processors have moved on and how they can potentially now compete with x86-64 chips. Even though Microsoft have launched the Surface Pro X, which uses an ARM chip and Apple are moving the Mac&amp;rsquo;s to ARM processors, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really considered just how far they&amp;rsquo;d come.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had a Raspberry Pi and various versions since they were released and have been able to adequately use the Pi3+ for minimal desktop use and I&amp;rsquo;ve had the iPad Pro for work for a number of years as well, which has performed quite well, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never really put two and two together on how well they compared to the X86 chips I have.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve resisted the high DPI screens for Windows machines for a number of years - mainly due to the cost of the screens. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve since upgraded a number of items and they now have larger screens.
My monitor is now a Dell S2719DC 27&amp;quot; which has a display of 2560 x 1440 and my Surface Pro 7 has a resolution of 2736 x 1824. Both of which require some Windows scaling to adequately use from my point of view.</description>

      <description>After some further experimentation and use, I’ve a few more comments on Inspire Writer. I have been initially impressed with the Windows Ulysses clone. My initial review was written in it and was written using the 10 day free trial period. I purchased the software after using it for a day on the Windows Store - so I’ve been using the Microsoft Store version. There is a stand alone version available as well, though I would hope that there is feature parity between the two.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been journaling now for years. I started off using Day One for iOS and macOS. However, after this updated to the second version and moved to a subscription model, I decided that I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to pay for it, and moved. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Zim Wiki for my journaling.
This has generally served me well, and ran nicely on Windows and Linux1. It worked and the output was portable and under my control, as each page is a text file and displays images inline.</description>

      <description>With the lockdown and working from home more often, I decided that my Synology (DS 116) was due for an upgrade. I wanted to retire one of my Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s that was running my Pi Hole server and I wanted to have a play with some of the features on the higher end Synology&amp;rsquo;s - such as virtual machines and Docker, as well as make use of the BTRFS file system, so that meant getting one of the Intel Atom powered Synology devices.</description>

      <description>One of the programs on macOS that I felt was missing on Windows was an alternative for Hazel. I spent ages looking around for an alternative, and the best I could find for a while was DropIt! The only issue with this is that DropIt is a bit more of a manual process in comparison to Hazel, as you have to drag and drop files into the program for them to be sorted1.</description>

      <description>One thing that had stuck with me from reading Coding Horror, is that you can increase the speed of your website with free bandwidth. In fairness, it&amp;rsquo;s not free bandwidth, it&amp;rsquo;s reducing the file size of the files that you&amp;rsquo;re hosting, so it&amp;rsquo;s faster to download. The Zopfli article above is the more recent one - the first was regarding pngout (article).
Both pngout and zopfli can reduce the size of files - specifically in this case, PNG files.</description>

      <description>Microsoft are making use of their purchase of Github to host the source for their ongoing work in to Powertoys.
PowerToys is a collection of applications that perform a range of different tasks that users may need to undertake regularly. There&amp;rsquo;s an Image Resizer that hooks in to the right click menu, there&amp;rsquo;s fancy zones, which expands upon Windows snap, by adding zones to snap to.
However, the big draw for me is PowerToys Run.</description>

      <description>So, a few years back, I almost moved away from Dropbox. In fact, I generally got away without using Dropbox at all, which worked out nicely. However, I went back and for a while, I&amp;rsquo;ve also had Dropbox lurking away on my system.
That is until today where I fell foul of the three device limit. On the free, basic tier, Dropbox only permits three devices to be used. This hadn&amp;rsquo;t effected me, as for the past year and a bit, I had my personal account linked to my Pro, office account.</description>

      <description>Apple Watch Faces I’ve been playing around with some Apple Watch faces recently - normally I would use a Modular Infographic face or at least one with a number of complications. However, I saw this one which I thought was a bit of fun.
As I’m going through a Star Wars phase again at the minute, I thought this was a good one.
I found the original artist here where you can download the image yourself.</description>

      <description>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been running in to issues with macOS that I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to resolve and it&amp;rsquo;s beginning to annoy me no end.
Startup I&amp;rsquo;d been running in to startup issues for a week or so - the Mac would boot up and I would see the Apple logo on screen with the loading bar.
However, the screen would then go blank and I would only see the mouse cursor if I wriggled it.</description>

Prior to finding it, I’d been using Dropbox to save a copy of my photos off my phone. This worked well, and the only reason I changed to PhotoSync was that I could choose different locations to send data (i.</description>

      <description>I work in engineering - one of the main formats that gets shared around a lot is the humble PDF. It often means that you can view exactly what the other person sees without the hassle of sharing additional items - I&amp;rsquo;m thinking CAD files here, where an architect may include a lot of references to external files within the CAD file that matches what the architect uses on the system, but won&amp;rsquo;t be installed in the same location or at all, on the clients machine.</description>

      <description>Cheap Mechanical Keyboard So I&amp;rsquo;ve been a fan of mechanical keyboards for a while - I&amp;rsquo;ve purchased a number of the years. The best one that I&amp;rsquo;ve used to date is the Matias Tactile Pro but that died after a few years of use, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also tried some of the other ones on the market. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really have a preference in terms of switches, but I&amp;rsquo;d tried the Matias ones, and quite liked them.</description>

      <description>iPad Magic Keyboard I tried using the keyboard and mouse with my iPad for a while to see how the iPad could cope with being a laptop replacement.
I concluded that I wouldn’t get the Magic Keyboard. However, here I am, typing this blog post on it.
Many people have already written reviews, so I’m a bit late to the game - they’ve pretty much given their opinion on it, and there isn’t a huge amount more I could add.</description>

      <description>Keyboard and Mouse with the iPad So, I’ve been playing around with the keyboard and mouse for the iPad Pro after Apple brought out the support for it in iPad OS 13.4.
I’ve been using the Filco 2 Tenkeyless Convertible keyboard and a Logitech MX Master mouse and have been using it on and off over the past week or so.
The whole intention of this is to consider if it’s worth purchasing the £300 iPad Magic with a touchpad keyboard for the iPad.</description>

      <description>Outlook for Mac One of the aspects that I thought would be good about working from home on the lockdown has come from being able to use my Mac. I’ve been able to use my Mac to do all things that I’d have to do on my Windows machine at work and it’s really given me a chance to see how the Mac would be able to perform my day to day job.</description>

      <description>Inspire Writer I&amp;rsquo;d been tossing up about purchasing a subscription to Ulysses on the Mac or not this year. In the end, I did and I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it for the last couple of blog posts that I&amp;rsquo;ve written. However, I&amp;rsquo;m not always on the Mac - I&amp;rsquo;m often on Windows and I miss using it when I am using Windows.
I&amp;rsquo;d been looking around for ages to find something that replicated it.</description>

      <description>Shush As Covid 19 spreads around the globe and countries go in to lockdown and work from home, I’ve had to do more and more meetings online.
When I’ve done online meetings in the past, I’ve had to do them either via conference call or via the conferencing setup at work, and therefore on Windows. They’ve generally worked OK.
However, as we’re all currently confined to working from home in the UK, I’ve been using my Mac.</description>

      <description>GPS Accuracy After a recent walk, I decided to analyse the data from the Garmin FIT files - one from my eTrex 25 and the other from my Apple Watch 4 and iPhone XR. I was purely interested in seeing how well the Garmin eTrex 25 was able to act as a tracker - mainly as when I was using it for my geocaching walk, it seemed to be tracking me, but looked on the screen to be sticking purely to the paths in the grounds of Wollaton Hall, which was a bit surprising.</description>

      <description>Apple Watch Step Counter One of things I&amp;rsquo;ve found missing from the Apple Watch is the ability to display your steps for the day. The Apple Watch does have the ring system - something that I&amp;rsquo;ve found to be generally better than the Garmin system as Garmin only tracks intensity minutes and steps but occasionally it&amp;rsquo;s nice to check my step count for the day. After all, the watch tracks the steps you take during the day, it seems odd that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t display it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve done something this week that I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve done for almost five years - I&amp;rsquo;ve removed Dropbox from my Mac.
gasp
I know, how could I?
Well, I think it&amp;rsquo;s slowly been a long time coming. Since I bought my Synology1, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using that more and more for various items. Up until recently however, it hadn&amp;rsquo;t come close enough to replacing Dropbox fully. However, I think the time now has come.</description>

      <title>Chromebook Review</title>

      <description>So I’ve been using a Chromebook now for a few weeks and I thought I’d say a few words on it. I’ve seen it slated in various places because of what it is (basically a dumb terminal with access to the web). However, whilst that’s pretty apt, I thought I’d mention my thoughts on it.
Chromebook I purchased the Samsung Series 3 Chromebook, partly due to it’s similarities to the Macbook Air.</description>
