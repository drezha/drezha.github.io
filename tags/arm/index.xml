      <description>There has been much talk on how well ARM processors have moved on and how they can potentially now compete with x86-64 chips. Even though Microsoft have launched the Surface Pro X, which uses an ARM chip and Apple are moving the Mac&amp;rsquo;s to ARM processors, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really considered just how far they&amp;rsquo;d come.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had a Raspberry Pi and various versions since they were released and have been able to adequately use the Pi3+ for minimal desktop use and I&amp;rsquo;ve had the iPad Pro for work for a number of years as well, which has performed quite well, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never really put two and two together on how well they compared to the X86 chips I have.</description>
