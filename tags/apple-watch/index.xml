      <description>Apple Watch Faces I’ve been playing around with some Apple Watch faces recently - normally I would use a Modular Infographic face or at least one with a number of complications. However, I saw this one which I thought was a bit of fun.
As I’m going through a Star Wars phase again at the minute, I thought this was a good one.
I found the original artist here where you can download the image yourself.</description>

      <description>GPS Accuracy After a recent walk, I decided to analyse the data from the Garmin FIT files - one from my eTrex 25 and the other from my Apple Watch 4 and iPhone XR. I was purely interested in seeing how well the Garmin eTrex 25 was able to act as a tracker - mainly as when I was using it for my geocaching walk, it seemed to be tracking me, but looked on the screen to be sticking purely to the paths in the grounds of Wollaton Hall, which was a bit surprising.</description>

      <description>Apple Watch Step Counter One of things I&amp;rsquo;ve found missing from the Apple Watch is the ability to display your steps for the day. The Apple Watch does have the ring system - something that I&amp;rsquo;ve found to be generally better than the Garmin system as Garmin only tracks intensity minutes and steps but occasionally it&amp;rsquo;s nice to check my step count for the day. After all, the watch tracks the steps you take during the day, it seems odd that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t display it.</description>
