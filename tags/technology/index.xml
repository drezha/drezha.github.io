      <title>Windows 10 DPI Scaling</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve resisted the high DPI screens for Windows machines for a number of years - mainly due to the cost of the screens. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve since upgraded a number of items and they now have larger screens.
My monitor is now a Dell S2719DC 27&amp;quot; which has a display of 2560 x 1440 and my Surface Pro 7 has a resolution of 2736 x 1824. Both of which require some Windows scaling to adequately use from my point of view.</description>

      <title>Colours for Hue</title>

      <description>Colours For Hue Getting Hue lights has meant that I need to control these. Generally, this works well using the Hue application and Siri (with HomeKit), though as I’ve got one in my office as well, it would be nice to control this from my Mac as well.
This is where Colours for Hue comes in. It’s a Mac app that sits in the menu bar and acts as a Hue light controller.</description>

      <title>Philips Hue</title>

      <description>Philips Hue I’ve had a number of smart items around the house now for a few years. These have mainly been the TP-Link smart plugs, but I’d also got two Elgato Eve smart plugs and a single TP-Link bulb.
In general, these have been OK, though they don’t all link together - TP-Link is controlled through its Kasa platform (and works with Alexa) but the Elgato plugs only work with Apple HomeKit and therefore have to be operated using our phones only (no HomePod).</description>

      <description>GPS Accuracy After a recent walk, I decided to analyse the data from the Garmin FIT files - one from my eTrex 25 and the other from my Apple Watch 4 and iPhone XR. I was purely interested in seeing how well the Garmin eTrex 25 was able to act as a tracker - mainly as when I was using it for my geocaching walk, it seemed to be tracking me, but looked on the screen to be sticking purely to the paths in the grounds of Wollaton Hall, which was a bit surprising.</description>

      <title>Apple Watch Step Counter</title>

      <description>Apple Watch Step Counter One of things I&amp;rsquo;ve found missing from the Apple Watch is the ability to display your steps for the day. The Apple Watch does have the ring system - something that I&amp;rsquo;ve found to be generally better than the Garmin system as Garmin only tracks intensity minutes and steps but occasionally it&amp;rsquo;s nice to check my step count for the day. After all, the watch tracks the steps you take during the day, it seems odd that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t display it.</description>
