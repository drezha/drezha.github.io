      <description>At the end of November, I had to go to Geneva for work - a one day workshop at CERN on fire risk. Considering it was the area I completed my PhD in and work were paying, what was not to like?
Anyhow, after some serious thought, I decided that I&amp;rsquo;d take my Brompton with me to Switzerland and that I&amp;rsquo;d enjoy some cycling around Geneva collecting some geocaches. I say serious thought, as it would mean that I would have to pay the Easyjet baggage fee to get there and back again!</description>
