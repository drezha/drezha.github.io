      <description>I wanted to compare the performance per watt of the new M1 Mac mini against that of my Ryzen 1600X powered gaming PC. To throw some additional items in there, I also measured my Ryzen 4300U little Windows office PC as well and my Raspberry Pi 4.
The speed of the new M1 Mac has shown that Apple’s move to Apple Silicon has been a good move for them. Benchmarks show that it’s faster than some of the Intel and AMD machines.</description>

      <description>There has been much talk on how well ARM processors have moved on and how they can potentially now compete with x86-64 chips. Even though Microsoft have launched the Surface Pro X, which uses an ARM chip and Apple are moving the Mac&amp;rsquo;s to ARM processors, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really considered just how far they&amp;rsquo;d come.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had a Raspberry Pi and various versions since they were released and have been able to adequately use the Pi3+ for minimal desktop use and I&amp;rsquo;ve had the iPad Pro for work for a number of years as well, which has performed quite well, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never really put two and two together on how well they compared to the X86 chips I have.</description>
