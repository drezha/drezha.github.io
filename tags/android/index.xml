      <description>Apple&amp;rsquo;s Live Photos and Android equivalent, Motion Photos, initially seemed a bit like a gimmick when they were announced. However, there are a number of times now where the Live Photos on the iPhone has been of good use - mainly to capture amusing antics before or after the photo occurred!
With playing with Android, I was surprised that this didn&amp;rsquo;t appear to have the same. However, after some googling, I discovered it does, and it&amp;rsquo;s called Motion Photos.</description>

      <title>Pixel 3a vs IPhone SE</title>

      <description>So, the iPhone SE was re-released, perhaps as a way for Apple to compete with the cheaper Android devices out there. Google started something similar last year with the release of the Pixel 3a - a cheaper, less powerful version of the Pixel 3.
I&amp;rsquo;ve tried both phones - I own the Pixel 3a and my wife has the iPhone SE 2020, so thought I&amp;rsquo;d write a quick review.
Camera The Pixel series is known for its camera, and the iPhone has always been well regarded for its camera - with Apple pushing the camera features heavily in various advertising.</description>
