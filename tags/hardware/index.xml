      <description>I’ve been playing about with new keyboards over the last few months - my most recent purchase is the Matias Quiet Pro for the Mac.
This is an American layout board that works with Bluetooth on the Mac and has a Mac based layout. It uses quiet Alps based keyswitches, rather than any of the Cherry MX or Cherry based knockoffs.
Quality The device feels sturdy enough when being used. However, there are some aspects that make it feel a bit cheaper than it should.</description>

      <description>Cheap Mechanical Keyboard So I&amp;rsquo;ve been a fan of mechanical keyboards for a while - I&amp;rsquo;ve purchased a number of the years. The best one that I&amp;rsquo;ve used to date is the Matias Tactile Pro but that died after a few years of use, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also tried some of the other ones on the market. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really have a preference in terms of switches, but I&amp;rsquo;d tried the Matias ones, and quite liked them.</description>

      <title>iPad Magic Keyboard</title>

      <description>iPad Magic Keyboard I tried using the keyboard and mouse with my iPad for a while to see how the iPad could cope with being a laptop replacement.
I concluded that I wouldn’t get the Magic Keyboard. However, here I am, typing this blog post on it.
Many people have already written reviews, so I’m a bit late to the game - they’ve pretty much given their opinion on it, and there isn’t a huge amount more I could add.</description>

      <title>Keyboard and Mouse with the iPad</title>

      <description>Keyboard and Mouse with the iPad So, I’ve been playing around with the keyboard and mouse for the iPad Pro after Apple brought out the support for it in iPad OS 13.4.
I’ve been using the Filco 2 Tenkeyless Convertible keyboard and a Logitech MX Master mouse and have been using it on and off over the past week or so.
The whole intention of this is to consider if it’s worth purchasing the £300 iPad Magic with a touchpad keyboard for the iPad.</description>
