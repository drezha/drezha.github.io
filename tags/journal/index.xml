      <description>Zim is a notebook type software - think Evernote or Onenote. However, it&amp;rsquo;s free and open source and saves data locally. It also saves all files as plain text, so you can access the files however and wherever you want.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it for a journal for a period of about three years now and I&amp;rsquo;ve written about it before. I did for a time switch back to Day One and tried the new syncing service, but when they had syncing issues earlier this year which exposed private data, I made sure I was back using Zim (syncing between my devices with Resilo Sync and stored on my own devices).</description>
