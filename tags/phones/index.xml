      <description>So, the iPhone SE was re-released, perhaps as a way for Apple to compete with the cheaper Android devices out there. Google started something similar last year with the release of the Pixel 3a - a cheaper, less powerful version of the Pixel 3.
I&amp;rsquo;ve tried both phones - I own the Pixel 3a and my wife has the iPhone SE 2020, so thought I&amp;rsquo;d write a quick review.
Camera The Pixel series is known for its camera, and the iPhone has always been well regarded for its camera - with Apple pushing the camera features heavily in various advertising.</description>
