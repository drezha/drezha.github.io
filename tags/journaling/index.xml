      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been journaling now for years. I started off using Day One for iOS and macOS. However, after this updated to the second version and moved to a subscription model, I decided that I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to pay for it, and moved. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Zim Wiki for my journaling.
This has generally served me well, and ran nicely on Windows and Linux1. It worked and the output was portable and under my control, as each page is a text file and displays images inline.</description>
