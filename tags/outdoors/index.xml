      <description>With some spare time at the weekend, I thought that I would get some practise in for my LEL award and I wanted to team this up with a geocaching trail that I&amp;rsquo;d seen. This way, I could go out and enjoy a day hike, whilst getting in some geocaching.
Route I&amp;rsquo;d done some hikes in the Peak District for cadets recently and had seen a number of caches with the acronym TAL - on a bit of digging, this appears to be short for The Alien Landings.</description>

      <description>My cycling has seemed to have dropped off somewhat since moving to Manchester. A downside to moving away from the London Brompton Club perhaps as I&amp;rsquo;ve not found a club up here that I&amp;rsquo;ve fancied doing much riding with as it&amp;rsquo;s not quite as welcoming and social as the LBC has been. I think that also weekend training exercises with cadets isn&amp;rsquo;t helpful to getting rides in at the weekend either!</description>
